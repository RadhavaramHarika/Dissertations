0,"1   CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  Problem Statement and Context  ""Quality cataloging"" is a concept whose meaning is often assumed to be universally understood, but do all catalogers really perceive this concept in the same way?  In 2008, cataloger J. McRee Elrod proclaimed that, “[c]learly the quality of catalogue records being added to bibliographic utilities and individual library catalogues is declining” (Elrod, 2008, p. 5).  Elrod does not include any evidence for this decline or the nature of the decline, but instead assumes by stating that the decline is ""clearly"" happening, that this perception is not uncommon.  However, can it be taken for granted that all catalogers conjure up the same definition of quality cataloging as Mr. Elrod?  Attempts to define the attributes of quality cataloging date back several decades and discussions in library science literature expressing concern over how to best approach library cataloging stretch back to the 19th century.  Within the last four decades, these discussions have become more pointed and heated.  Even though some basic points can be agreed upon regarding the attributes of quality cataloging, general consensus on these attributes has remained largely elusive.  With the recent introduction of the new cataloging standard Resource Description and Access (RDA), new concern has surfaced about the direction of ""quality cataloging"" and what this concept can (and should) encompass.  The problems this study addresses are the ambiguous nature of ""quality"" in cataloging and the difficulties in assessing what quality cataloging means due to differing perceptions of this concept among professional and non-professional catalogers in academic libraries.  The differing perceptions may be due to many reasons, such as local practice, type of library and user 2  population, cataloging education/training, and the specific demands of one's position (e.g., a technical services manager looking to cut costs may have a different perception of quality than a professional cataloger).  Perceptions of cataloging quality may also alter over time due to changes in and/or limitations of technology, as well as cataloging standards and rules.  By studying cataloger perceptions of cataloging quality, a greater understanding of cataloger expectations and motivations in regard to the creation of bibliographic records will be gained. The study examines the reasons for these perceptions and whether or not these perceptions have changed over time (and if they have, in what ways have they changed).  Background of the Problem  The notion of “quality"" has been discussed at great length in various academic disciplines, particularly business.  The American Society for Quality, which is a ""global community of experts and the leading authority on quality"" for areas such as education, government, healthcare, manufacturing, and service (American Society for Quality, 2011), currently defines quality as: A subjective term for which each person or sector has its own definition. In technical usage, quality can have two meanings: 1. the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs; 2. a product or service free of deficiencies. (American Society for Quality, 2011)  For hundreds of years, business organizations have attempted to define quality, but results have varied widely.  Quality has been defined as value; conformance to specifications; conformance to requirements; fitness for use; loss avoidance; and meeting and/or exceeding customers' expectations (Reeves & Bednar, 1994, p. 419).  These definitions do not necessarily conflict with one another, but nonetheless represent different viewpoints and measurement problems.   Reeves and Bednar (1994) conclude that defining quality using only one viewpoint neglects the 3  complexity and (oftentimes) subjectivity of the concept; attempts to define quality too broadly to encompass all of these meanings would result in a definition with little utility when it comes to evaluating quality in objective terms.     “Cataloging is an art, not a science,” Charles Cutter noted in the preface to the fourth edition of his Rules for a Dictionary Catalog (1904, p. 6).  The idea that the practice of cataloging requires more than a strict conformance to rules flows through much of library literature in which quality cataloging is discussed. Cataloging necessitates a tolerance for ambiguity and the ability to create a comprehensible, surrogate representation of an item where standardization can be often elusive.  This necessity complicates the search for a straightforward definition of quality cataloging.  The process of defining quality cataloging has been compared to defining pornography (Bruce & Hillmann, 2004) and to defining art: “As with the person who cannot define art but knows it when he sees it, I cannot completely define a good cataloguing record, but I know it when I retrieve it” (Avdoyan, 1993, p. 5).  ""Quality cataloging"" has been defined in many ways in library science literature.  Some definitions are very specific and some less so:  Accurate bibliographic information that meets users' needs and provides appropriate access in a timely fashion. (Cataloging quality, 1995, p. 28)  What library users say it is. (Calhoun via Wasylenko, 1999, p. 102)   Level of content (AACR2 level of description, inclusion of subject classification or subject headings, authority control of headings, etc.)...accuracy of content (in transcription from the item, in conformity with the standards applied)...fitness for purpose. (MacEwan & Young, 2004, p. 2)  We define quality for support staff by percentage error rate in the following: selection or suitability of OCLC record as a match for item cataloged; correcting typographical errors in the following fields: 100, 245, 260, 300, 5xx; making appropriate edits to bibliographic and holdings records; accurate creation of item and holdings records; recognizing cataloging problems and bringing them to the attention of a supervisor. For cataloging librarians: quality is defined by excellent original cataloging based on AACR2 full-level 4  standards; name authority records created to standards set by NACO; effective supervision of support staff, including timely resolution of questions and problems; a reasonable turnaround time for materials so that a backlog is not created or growing; responsiveness to needs of internal and external patrons; completeness, efficiency, responsive to queries and complaints. (Primary Research Group, 2008, p. 136)  Even though several of these definitions express some of the same attributes of quality cataloging, they also reflect differing concerns and focus similar to what is found in business literature.  Cataloger's Judgment  The concept of cataloger's judgment can partially explain why there are differing perceptions of quality cataloging among catalogers. Ferris (2008) defined cataloger's judgment as ""the level of expertise attained by each cataloger after years of having interpreted and applied the principles of bibliographic control"" (p. 179). One could also argue that cataloger's judgment is not solely about level of expertise, but rather the cataloger's ability to utilize that expertise to make informed cataloging decisions.  Since the standard cataloging rule book in the English-speaking world, the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2), cannot cover every possible cataloging situation encountered by a cataloger, cataloger's judgment is instrumental in allowing the cataloger the freedom to adapt cataloging practice and rules in ways that the cataloger feels will best meet their users' needs.  This judgment is usually developed and refined over time as the cataloger gains more experience cataloging information objects and navigating the various cataloging tools, such as AACR2 and the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).  Santamauro and Adams (2006) explained that ""[w]hile catalogers' judgment is often assumed to be 'common sense,' it is actually the result of cataloging culture, hands-on experience, and education"" (p. 13).   5   Catalogers' judgment is an essential tool for navigating the complexity of information organization, but it can also lead to a lack of uniformity in the cataloging process and bibliographic records.  This lack of uniformity, in turn, leads to what some may consider a lack of quality cataloging. For example, a cataloger may decide to not include all the access points for those involved in the creation of a DVD due to time constraints or due to lack of user interest in such information. If this record is included in a networked cataloging environment, such as the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) network, it may be considered lacking in quality for libraries with users who value additional access points for this type of information object.  Since AACR2 does not state a minimum or maximum number of added access points that can be included in a bibliographic record, records produced under either scenario are technically correct.  However, the ""quality"" of each record is perceived differently depending on the judgment of the cataloger.  Research Questions  This study seeks answers to the following research questions:  1) How do catalogers currently define quality cataloging?  2) How do catalogers distinguish ""quality"" in terms of the cataloging process, the catalog record (as a product, or artifact, of the process), adherence to standards, and impact upon users?  3) What characteristics of a bibliographic record, including field/subfield usage for content designation, are perceived to be the most important to catalogers when they judge the quality of a record?  4) How is local cataloging practice influenced by cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging?   Chapter 3 gives further background on each of the research questions and the methods used to answer them.    6  Delimitations and Limitations  Due to the fact that this study was intended to explore cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging, there was no attempt to determine an objective definition of quality cataloging.  In addition, the focus population of this study was limited to catalogers who work in an academic library, perform original cataloging, and are either classified as professional or non-professional in their employment status. The perceptions of catalogers outside of this population were not considered and could be the focus of future studies.  In addition, library user opinions of quality cataloging were not examined by this study. Even though the OCLC (2009a) study of user and librarian perceptions of quality in the WorldCat database provides general insight on this topic, there needs to be more research performed by academic libraries at the local level (as suggested by Chapman and Massey (2002) and Hider and Tan (2008)) to determine the quality cataloging attributes that would best serve a specific library's user population.    This study reveals how study participants' perceptions of quality cataloging influence local cataloging policy; however, this study did not examine department policy and procedure manuals to see if these quality perceptions were present in actual policy and procedure.  A future study that included this examination would help to generate a more complete picture of how cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging influence local cataloging policy.  Purpose and Significance of the Study  Hider and Tan, in their 2008 study of quality cataloging, asked seven cataloging experts to rank the same five bibliographic record sets of Library of Congress full-level records from best to worst in terms of quality. Each of the seven experts ranked the record sets differently.  If ""cataloging experts"" cannot agree on what constitutes quality cataloging and cataloger's 7  judgment is involved, is it possible to define quality cataloging at all?  Or, perhaps more appropriately, is it possible to define quality cataloging in such a way that would be universally applicable to all cataloging situations? In addition, even if it is possible to come to a general agreement on the definition of quality cataloging, why is it important to define it at all?  In regards to the first question about the possibility of defining quality cataloging, it could be argued that, even if every cataloger cannot agree on the same attributes, most catalogers could agree upon a baseline standard for what should be in a bibliographic record that would allow for user access, such as the Program for Cooperative Cataloging's (PCC) BIBCO standard record (BSR).  Baseline standards may be a good starting point in assessing quality, but are minimum, agreed-upon standards enough to earn the title of ""quality cataloging""?  It could also be argued that quality cataloging cannot be defined in such a way that is applicable to all cataloging situations because each cataloging environment has its own unique set of challenges, differing user populations, and administrative expectations. Attempts to construct an objective definition could even be detrimental; catalogers might be forced into cataloging in such a way that may not best fit the needs of their users in order to follow a supposed objective definition of quality cataloging. In such a situation, it is not necessary or even helpful to construct a general definition of quality cataloging that attempts to cover all cataloging environments.    This study does not attempt to formulate an objective definition of quality cataloging. Instead, it examines the perception of cataloging quality from the perspective of catalogers and how these perceptions affect the expectations and actions of catalogers when they create and evaluate bibliographic records. Studying cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging is important because it is catalogers (particularly original catalogers) who are largely responsible for what is 8  included in bibliographic records. Even if original catalogers do not have the authority to decide everything that goes into an original record, they may have influence upon cataloging department policies that govern what should and should not be in a bibliographic record created and/or accepted by that department.    The purpose of the current study is to collect and examine cataloger definitions of and thoughts concerning quality cataloging in order to determine what they feel are the most important attributes of the cataloging process and bibliographic record, as well as their opinions about the application of cataloging standards and how the cataloging process and product impacts users. The exploration of these perceptions of quality cataloging will produce a greater understanding of how catalogers approach their work and how these perceptions impact records produced, as well as departmental policy, if at all.   Definitions  Taylor (2006) defines ""cataloging"" as ""the process of creating surrogate records for information packages by describing the information package, choosing name and title access points, conducting subject analysis, assigning subject headings and classification numbers, and maintaining the system through which records are made available"" (pp. 528-529).    For the purposes of this study, ""original cataloging"" is defined as the creation of a new record that does not contain any prior data and/or the editing of an existing record that previously contained only very minimal data.    Perception is defined as ""the process through which sensations are interpreted, using knowledge and understanding of the world, so that they become meaningful experiences"" (Bernstein, Clarke-Stewart, Roy, Srull, & Wickens, 1994, p. 175). In this study, ""perception"" is 9  not used in what Berstein et al. (1994) call the ""ecological view"" or the ""computational view,"" both of which focus more on environmental stimuli and the human body's reactions to such stimuli.  Instead, ""perception"" is examined from the ""constructionist"" viewpoint, which focuses on human expectations, inferences, and understanding about reality and, subsequently, the meaning humans ascribe to that reality (Bernstein, et al., 1994, pp. 176-177).   The literature review in Chapter 2 provides a review of how quality cataloging has been discussed in library and information science literature.  ","1 chapter 1 introduction problem statement and context ""quality cataloging"" is a concept whose meaning is often assumed to be universally understood, but do all catalogers really perceive this concept in the same way? in 2008, cataloger j. mcree elrod proclaimed that, “[c]learly the quality of catalogue records being added to bibliographic utilities and individual library catalogues is declining” (elrod, 2008, p. 5). elrod does not include any evidence for this decline or the nature of the decline, but instead assumes by stating that the decline is ""clearly"" happening, that this perception is not uncommon. however, can it be taken for granted that all catalogers conjure up the same definition of quality cataloging as mr. elrod? attempts to define the attributes of quality cataloging date back several decades and discussions in library science literature expressing concern over how to best approach library cataloging stretch back to the 19th century. within the last four decades, these discussions have become more pointed and heated. even though some basic points can be agreed upon regarding the attributes of quality cataloging, general consensus on these attributes has remained largely elusive. with the recent introduction of the new cataloging standard resource description and access (rda), new concern has surfaced about the direction of ""quality cataloging"" and what this concept can (and should) encompass. the problems this study addresses are the ambiguous nature of ""quality"" in cataloging and the difficulties in assessing what quality cataloging means due to differing perceptions of this concept among professional and non-professional catalogers in academic libraries. the differing perceptions may be due to many reasons, such as local practice, type of library and user 2 population, cataloging education/training, and the specific demands of one's position (e.g., a technical services manager looking to cut costs may have a different perception of quality than a professional cataloger). perceptions of cataloging quality may also alter over time due to changes in and/or limitations of technology, as well as cataloging standards and rules. by studying cataloger perceptions of cataloging quality, a greater understanding of cataloger expectations and motivations in regard to the creation of bibliographic records will be gained. the study examines the reasons for these perceptions and whether or not these perceptions have changed over time (and if they have, in what ways have they changed). background of the problem the notion of “quality"" has been discussed at great length in various academic disciplines, particularly business. the american society for quality, which is a ""global community of experts and the leading authority on quality"" for areas such as education, government, healthcare, manufacturing, and service (american society for quality, 2011), currently defines quality as: a subjective term for which each person or sector has its own definition. in technical usage, quality can have two meanings: 1. the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs; 2. a product or service free of deficiencies.

cataloguing rules 2nd edition aacr2 cannot cover every possible cataloging situation encountered by a cataloger catalogers judgment is instrumental in allowing the cataloger the freedom to adapt

cataloging information objects and navigating the various cataloging tools such as aacr2 and the library of congress subject headings lcsh santamauro and adams 2006 explained that while catalogers judgment is often assumed to be common sense it is actually the result of cataloging culture handson experience and education p 13 5 catalogers judgment is an essential tool for navigating the complexity of information organization but it can also lead to a lack of uniformity in the cataloging process and bibliographic records this lack of uniformity in turn leads to what some may consider a lack of quality cataloging for example a cataloger may decide to not include all the access points for those involved in the creation of a dvd due to time constraints or due to lack of user interest in such information if this record is included in a networked cataloging environment such as the online computer library center oclc network it may be considered lacking in quality for libraries with users who value additional access points for this type of information object since aacr2 does not state a minimum or maximum number of added access points that can be included in a bibliographic record records produced under either scenario are technically correct however the quality of each record is perceived differently depending on the judgment of the cataloger research questions this study seeks answers to the following research questions 1 how do catalogers currently define quality cataloging 2 how do catalogers distinguish quality in terms of the cataloging process the catalog record as a product or artifact of the process adherence to standards and impact upon users 3 what characteristics of a bibliographic record including fieldsubfield usage for content designation are perceived to be the most important to catalogers when they judge the quality of a record 4 how is local cataloging practice influenced by cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging chapter 3 gives further background on each of the research questions and the methods used to answer them 6 delimitations and limitations due to the fact that this study was intended to explore cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging there was no attempt to determine an objective definition of quality cataloging in addition the focus population of this study was limited to catalogers who work in an academic library perform original cataloging and are either classified as professional or nonprofessional in their employment status the perceptions of catalogers outside of this population were not considered and could be the focus of future studies in addition library user opinions of quality cataloging were not examined by this study even though the oclc 2009a study of user and librarian perceptions of quality in the worldcat database provides general insight on this topic there needs to be more research performed by academic libraries at the local level as suggested by chapman and massey 2002 and hider and tan 2008 to determine the quality cataloging attributes that would best serve a specific librarys user population this study reveals how study participants perceptions of quality cataloging influence local cataloging policy however this study did not examine department policy and procedure manuals to see if these quality perceptions were present in actual policy and procedure a future study that included this examination would help to generate a more complete picture of how cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging influence local cataloging policy purpose and significance of the study hider and tan in their 2008 study of quality cataloging asked seven cataloging experts to rank the same five bibliographic record sets of library of congress fulllevel records from best to worst in terms of quality each of the seven experts ranked the record sets differently if cataloging experts cannot agree on what constitutes quality cataloging and catalogers 7 judgment is involved is it possible to define quality cataloging at all or perhaps more appropriately is it possible to define quality cataloging in such a way that would be universally applicable to all cataloging situations in addition even if it is possible to come to a general agreement on the definition of quality cataloging why is it important to define it at all in regards to the first question about the possibility of defining quality cataloging it could be argued that even if every cataloger cannot agree on the same attributes most catalogers could agree upon a baseline standard for what should be in a bibliographic record that would allow for user access such as the program for cooperative catalogings pcc bibco standard record bsr baseline standards may be a good starting point in assessing quality but are minimum agreedupon standards enough to earn the title of quality cataloging it could also be argued that quality cataloging cannot be defined in such a way that is applicable to all cataloging situations because each cataloging environment has its own unique set of challenges differing user populations and administrative expectations attempts to construct an objective definition could even be detrimental catalogers might be forced into cataloging in such a way that may not best fit the needs of their users in order to follow a supposed objective definition of quality cataloging in such a situation it is not necessary or even helpful to construct a general definition of quality cataloging that attempts to cover all cataloging environments this study does not attempt to formulate an objective definition of quality cataloging instead it examines the perception of cataloging quality from the perspective of catalogers and how these perceptions affect the expectations and actions of catalogers when they create and evaluate bibliographic records studying cataloger perceptions of quality cataloging is important because it is catalogers particularly original catalogers who are largely responsible for what is 8 included in bibliographic records even if original catalogers do not have the authority to decide everything that goes into an original record they may have influence upon cataloging department policies that govern what should and should not be in a bibliographic record created andor accepted by that department the purpose of the current study is to collect and examine cataloger definitions of and thoughts concerning quality cataloging in order to determine what they feel are the most important attributes of the cataloging process and bibliographic record as well as their opinions about the application of cataloging standards and how the cataloging process and product impacts users the exploration of these perceptions of quality cataloging will produce a greater understanding of how catalogers approach their work and how these perceptions impact records produced as well as departmental policy if at all definitions taylor 2006 defines cataloging as the process of creating surrogate records for information packages by describing the information package choosing name and title access points conducting subject analysis assigning subject headings and classification numbers and maintaining the system through which records are made available pp 528529 for the purposes of this study original cataloging is defined as the creation of a new record that does not contain any prior data andor the editing of an existing record that previously contained only very minimal data perception is defined as the process through which sensations are interpreted

et al 1994 call the ecological view or the computational view both of which focus more on environmental stimuli and the human bodys reactions to such stimuli instead perception is examined from the constructionist viewpoint which focuses on human expectations inferences and understanding about reality and subsequently the meaning humans ascribe to that reality bernstein et al 1994 pp 176177 the literature review in chapter 2 provides a review of how quality cataloging has been discussed in library and information science literature,1 chapter 1 introduction problem statement and context quality cataloging is a concept whose meaning is often assumed to be universally understood but do all catalogers really perceive this concept in the same way in 2008 cataloger j mcree elrod proclaimed that clearly the quality of catalogue records being added to bibliographic utilities and individual library catalogues is declining elrod 2008 p 5 elrod does not include any evidence for this decline or the nature of the decline but instead assumes by stating that the decline is clearly happening that this perception is not uncommon however can it be taken for granted that all catalogers conjure up the same definition of quality cataloging as mr elrod attempts to define the attributes of quality cataloging date back several decades and discussions in library science literature expressing concern over how to best approach library cataloging stretch back to the 19th century within the last four decades these discussions have become more pointed and heated even though some basic points can be agreed upon regarding the attributes of quality cataloging general consensus on these attributes has remained largely elusive with the recent introduction of the new cataloging standard resource description and access rda new concern has surfaced about the direction of quality cataloging and what this concept can and should encompass the problems this study addresses are the ambiguous nature of quality in cataloging and the difficulties in assessing what quality cataloging means due to differing perceptions of this concept among professional and nonprofessional catalogers in academic libraries the differing perceptions may be due to many reasons such as local practice type of library and user 2 population cataloging educationtraining and the specific demands of ones position eg a technical services manager looking to cut costs may have a different perception of quality than a professional cataloger perceptions of cataloging quality may also alter over time due to changes in andor limitations of technology as well as cataloging standards and rules by studying cataloger perceptions of cataloging quality a greater understanding of cataloger expectations and motivations in regard to the creation of bibliographic records will be gained the study examines the reasons for these perceptions and whether or not these perceptions have changed over time and if they have in what ways have they changed background of the problem the notion of quality has been discussed at great length in various academic disciplines particularly business the american society for quality which is a global community of experts and the leading authority on quality for areas such as education government healthcare manufacturing and service american society for quality 2011 currently defines quality as a subjective term for which each person or sector has its own definition in technical usage quality can have two meanings 1 the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs 2 a product or service free of deficiencies american society for quality 2011 for hundreds of years business organizations have attempted to define quality but results have varied widely quality has been defined as value conformance to specifications conformance to requirements fitness for use loss avoidance and meeting andor exceeding customers expectations reeves bednar 1994 p 419 these definitions do not necessarily conflict with one another but nonetheless represent different viewpoints and measurement problems reeves and bednar 1994 conclude that defining quality using only one viewpoint neglects the 3 complexity and oftentimes subjectivity of the concept attempts to define quality too broadly to encompass all of these meanings would result in a definition with little utility when it comes to evaluating quality in objective terms cataloging is an art not a science charles cutter noted in the preface to the fourth edition of his rules for a dictionary catalog 1904 p 6 the idea that the practice of cataloging requires more than a strict conformance to rules flows through much of library literature in which quality cataloging is discussed cataloging necessitates a tolerance for ambiguity and the ability to create a comprehensible surrogate representation of an item where standardization can be often elusive this necessity complicates the search for a straightforward definition of quality cataloging the process of defining quality cataloging has been compared to defining pornography bruce hillmann 2004 and to defining art as with the person who cannot define art but knows it when he sees it i cannot completely define a good cataloguing record but i know it when i retrieve it avdoyan 1993 p 5 quality cataloging has been defined in many ways in library science literature some definitions are very specific and some less so accurate bibliographic

these definitions express some of the same attributes of quality cataloging they also reflect differing concerns and focus similar to what is found in business literature catalogers judgment the

1,"1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION Purpose of Study The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between types of health information tasks and the Internet information search processes of Chinese graduate students at the University of North Texas (UNT). The search process was analyzed by looking at the source used to start the search, language selection, use of online translation tools, and time spent.  Background In the United States (U.S.), looking for health information online is one of the most popular online activities, and more than 80% Internet users and 59% of all adults have searched health information (Fox, 2011). Internet health information covers a variety of health topics, and the content varies in the level of depth. Searching for health or medical information is one of the most common online activities next to email and product or service research (Fox & Fallows, 2003). The top three health topics searched are a specific disease or medical problem, certain medical treatment or procedure, and exercise or fitness (Fox & Jones, 2009). At the same time, Internet health information has impacted users’ utilization of health information. About 60% of Internet health information seekers report that information found on the Internet assists them in making medical decisions, maintaining health, and having discussions with their doctors (Fox & Jones, 2009). The Internet has become increasingly important as a source of health information (Cohen & Stussman, 2010).  2 The popularity of searching Internet health information and its health-related impact has generated research studies. Researchers are interested in users’ health information needs and information behaviors (e.g., Dutta-Bergman, 2004; Graham, Tse, & Keselman, 2006). Numerous studies of Internet health information seeking have focused on who searches for health information online, why they choose Internet as their medium, what kind of information sources they use, and how they search (e.g., Eysenbach & Köhler, 2002; Morahan-Martin, 2004). User studies have been conducted on groups of health professionals, patients, women, seniors, college students, or people of low literacy (Beverley, Bath, & Barber, 2007; Casebeer, Bennett, Kristofco, Carillo, & Centor, 2002; Flynn, Smith, & Freese, 2006; Ivanitskaya, O’Boyle, & Casey, 2006; Murray  et al., 2006; Sillence, Briggs, Harris, & Fishwicka, 2007). Attention has also been paid to digitally divided minorities, such as Hispanics, Africa Americans, and Asians (e.g., Cleveland et al., 2008; Pena-Purcell, 2008). The barriers of language, medical terminology, culture and social economic levels have been identified in Internet health information searching (Edejer, 2000; Morahan-Martin, 2004). Through the analysis of multilingual search logs, users from different backgrounds behave differently and have identifiable patterns in their searches (Ghorab, Leveling, Zhou, Jones, & Wade, 2010). The cross-cultural Internet health information searching is complicated in searching patterns, types of sites visited, and usage of online information (Harris, 2002). Health information searches usually start from an inquiry comprising of either internal personal health concerns or external needs for others. In the area of information science, query, query formulation, and query analysis are often discussed in relation to information retrieval systems. The term, task, has been mentioned often in the context of information seeking 3 process. Vakkari (2003) defined task as an activity to be performed in order to accomplish a goal. Users need to accomplish search tasks through a series of actions with information resources on the Internet. English and Chinese are the most widely used languages on the Internet. Multilingual users in multilingual environments are able to take advantage of various information resources written in multiple languages. However, multilingual searching on the Internet has not been well explored (Rieh & Rieh, 2005). There are research gaps in information seeking in the multilingual world (Zhou, 2006).  Chinese students are the largest group of international students in the United States (Institute of International Education, 2011). The U.S. continues to be the top destination for Chinese students seeking higher education overseas. In 2011, there were 157,558 Chinese students studying in the U.S. and the rate of change increased to 23.5% (Institute of International Education, 2011). At the UNT Denton campus, a total of 332 Chinese students were enrolled in Fall 2011, which is almost four times larger than the enrollment number of 85 in Fall 2006 (University of North Texas, 2006, 2011). Problem Statement Although Chinese students represent a significant demographic group in the U.S., there is limited knowledge of their Internet health information search processes. No study had been conducted on factors that may influence the Internet health information search processes of Chinese students in the U.S. This is the problem addressed in this dissertation. This study examined how these Chinese graduate students conducted Internet information searches to complete different types of search tasks. 4 Designing health information systems for diverse populations has been hindered by a lack of knowledge about the information seeking behavior of different cultures. This dissertation is specifically concerned about the impact of types of health information search tasks, in regards to the Internet information search processes of Chinese students. How do different types of health information tasks influence their Internet information search processes?  Significance of Study Research on the factors that influence Chinese students’ Internet health information searching not only helps information professionals to understand Chinese individual’s health information seeking behavior, but also enriches health information user studies in general. Understanding how Chinese students search for health information can assist in information systems design and library services geared toward underserved minorities. There is a need for information systems design to focus on constructing language and culture sensitive health information sources for minorities (Cleveland et al., 2009). The experiences of Chinese students’ Internet health information search processes provide first-hand data to understand how they seek information. How people search information is a major aspect of database interface design and functions modeling. The study can assist system developers in gaining a greater understanding of the searching practices of Chinese students.  Regarding library services toward underserved minorities, this study may be useful for libraries to design instructional training tools to help minorities to efficiently access online health information sources.  5 Definitions Chinese graduate students: International graduate students from China enrolled in the University of North Texas, Denton Campus. Exploratory task: A task which can broader a searcher’s knowledge of a topic. Factual task: A task which asks a searcher for specific data. Information search process: A progressive series of activities that begin with a question and culminate in the identification of sources and information that aim to address the question. In this study the activities investigated are (a) sources used to start the search, (b) the selection of the language used in the search, (c) the use of online translation tools, and (d) the search time spent. Internet health information: Any health related information available on the Internet, regardless of the origin or format. Interpretive task: A task that requires a searcher to think and to configure an answer.  Task: An activity to be performed in order to accomplish a goal (Vakkari, 2003). Task types: There are three types of tasks which are adopted from Kim’s study (2009), factual task, interpretive task, and exploratory task. Online translation tools: Online bilingual dictionaries or any online assistant tools which can help the term translation from one language to another language. Research Questions The global research question of this study was: Do the types of tasks have any effect on the Internet search processes of Chinese graduate students looking for health information? The following research questions and hypotheses were addressed in this study:  6 R1.  Do Chinese graduate students vary in the selection of sources used to start their search depending upon the types of health information tasks?  H0.  There is no significant difference in the selection of sources used to start their search among the types of health information tasks. R2. Do Chinese graduate students vary in their language selection depending upon the types of health information tasks? H0. There is no significant difference in their language selection among the types of health information tasks. R3.  Do Chinese graduate students vary in their use of online translation tools depending upon the types of health information tasks? H0. There is no significant difference in their use of using online translation tools among the types of health information tasks. R4. Do Chinese graduate students vary in the time spent depending upon the types of health information tasks? H0. There is no significant difference in the time spent among the types of health information tasks. Assumptions and Limitations of Study It was assumed that Chinese graduate students were proficient in both the English and Chinese languages. Graduate students were assumed to have experience searching the Internet. Also, it was assumed that participants in the study would answer the questionnaires truthfully. This study was limited to Chinese graduate students at the University of North Texas. Forty-five Chinese graduate students participated in the study. This selected group of Chinese students was not representative of the whole Chinese population in the U.S.  This was a within-group experimental study. It focused on the types of health information tasks and did not cover other factors which influence the Internet health information search process, such as, cognitive styles and health conditions. The time spent was 7 estimated and not absolutely quantified, due to the nature of the logging function in the Web browser used. Summary Searching Internet health information is one of most popular online activities. Internet health information has impacted on Internet users. To design health information systems or sources for diverse populations requires a good understanding of their information seeking behaviors. There is little known about Internet health information search processes of Chinese graduate students. There is a need for research to address this issue and support the information services and system design which aim to help Chinese students efficiently access health information.   This chapter provided a brief introduction to the study. The specific purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between types of health information tasks and the Internet search processes of Chinese students. Chapter 2 presents theoretical perspectives of health information seeking behavior, and discusses studies on search tasks, Web search behavior, multilingual information searching, and Internet health information. ","1 chapter 1 introduction purpose of study the purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between types of health information tasks and the internet information search

2,"1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Introduction and Background This research study is conducted to test Workman, Fiszman, Rindflesch and Nahl’s (2014) information flow – serendipitous knowledge discovery (IF-SKD) model of information behavior, in a clinical care context.  To date, there have been few attempts to model the serendipitous knowledge discovery of physicians. Due to the growth and complexity of the biomedical literature, as well as the increasingly specialized nature of medicine, there is a need for advanced systems that can quickly present information and assist physicians to discover new knowledge.  The National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) Lister Hill Center for Biocommunication’s Semantic MEDLINE project is focused on identifying and visualizing semantic relationships in the biomedical literature to support knowledge discovery. This project led to the development of a new information discovery system, Spark.  The aim of Spark is to promote serendipitous knowledge discovery by assisting users in maximizing the use of their conceptual short-term memory to iteratively search for, engage, clarify and evaluate information presented from the biomedical literature.  Using Spark, this study analyzes the IF-SKD model by capturing and analyzing physician feedback.  The McCay-Peet, Toms and Kelloway’s (2015) Perception of Serendipity and Serendipitous Digital Environment questionnaires are used.  Results are evaluated to determine whether Spark contributes to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery and the ability of the IF-SKD ability to capture physicians’ information behavior in a clinical setting2  The concept, study and application of serendipitous knowledge discovery (SKD) are not new to the field of information science.  Over the years, the idea of discovery through serendipity, or “information encountering” has been studied and understood using a variety of methods with varied outcomes, though some common themes (Erdelez, 1997).  However, few formal models exist that are derived from information science and its literature.  Foster and Ford (2003) noted that due to serendipity’s “elusive, unpredictable” nature, SKD is challenging to understand within existing information behavior models (p. 321).  Often, technical and psychosocial factors are at the heart of understanding this behavior.  Intervening variables such as age, education, task, personality, information need, prior knowledge, etc. play a role as well (Burkell, Quan-Hase & Rubin, 2012; Heinström, 2006; Spink, 2004).  Yet, despite these fundamental complexities, it is paramount that in today’s richly complex information world, the study of serendipitous knowledge discovery remains a priority.  The IF-SKD model is a step in this direction, and its further analysis only aids in its development and refinement.   In contrast to the study of SKD, physicians’ information behavior is quite rich.  Because some aspects of clinical workflow, and the often-required information technologies that drive it are process driven, there are numerous studies that review the utility of an array of information resource solutions within those workflows.  For example, Del Fiol et al. (2012) and others have shown how context driven infobuttons information have helped meet clinical information needs.  For years, electronic medical records (EMRs) have contained clinical alerting mechanisms designed to provide safety precautions within the use of certain activities, such as drug administration, when known issues exist that could cause harm, such as drug interactions and black box warnings.  A strong motivation in the literature has been to maximize the utility, 3 automation and breadth of content available to physicians, and then to study how that content (or system) was used, and whether access to the information impacted their clinical decision making.  One study explored physicians’ questions within the EMR workflow to ascertain the situational factors likely to resolve unmet information needs through the implementation of solutions that can address them specific points in the workflow (Cimino, Li, Bakken & Patel, 2002).  Another collected and categorized the types of unmet information needs (Currie et al., 2003). These are important topics yet are all predicated on a known (or anticipated) user information need.  Accounting for the unformed and unknown needs of physicians, including how best to model those needs as well as apply them to the design of new tools and system, is an area needing further exploration.  General models of SKD that have been developed are relatively new, especially in their application to system design and even more particularly in their lack of application to physicians within the clinical setting.  Essential to both physicians’ information behavior and the idea of SKD is an understanding of existing information resources and content (including the rich taxonomies and controlled vocabularies contributing to it) that comprise the biomedical literature.  Within the biomedical information space, there are numerous information resources.  The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has been central to the creation and growth of these online databases and resources, which offer unique and powerful access to information.  Years of careful and meaningful curation of underlying data has, in large part, made this possible.  However, for many resources, there is the inherent assumption of a goal, or known information need by the user.  Only recently have tools been designed to support serendipitous knowledge discovery for 4 situations where a goal (or information need) is not present, or potentially unknown by the user. These rich information resources, and their underlying metadata provide the ideal springboard from which to build new systems that can promote serendipitous discovery.  Through improved system design, the meaningful identification of semantic relationships, and the use of information visualization, these new tools can assist in modeling an iterative information seeking process that improves not only outcomes, but also “reduc[es] the cognitive demands of information organization” by ultimately increasing the chance for serendipitous knowledge discovery (Workman, Fiszman, Rindflesch & Nahl, 2014).  New systems should be built to support SKD within the clinical setting.  The task of future researchers is to better understand how these systems should be examined in order to explain how system design equates with the discipline’s understanding of serendipitous knowledge discovery as a type of information behavior.  In turn, this helps address another major challenge, which is the growth and specialization of biomedical information.   Statement of the Problem The increased specialization of the medical field, along with the enormous growth of biomedical information, pose unique challenges for how best to identify, present and use information in effective ways within the clinical care setting.  Physicians, who can benefit greatly through the consumption and application of relevant information, are often challenged with effective ways to discover it.  Systems are just beginning to incorporate SKD design principles.  Of those, few are effectively integrating rich data structures, such as semantic 5 predications with effective visualization and refinement techniques. The Spark application, which is designed based on the recently developed IF-SKD model, provides opportunities to increase moments of serendipitous knowledge discovery. At the present time, there is no understanding of Spark’s efficacy to address these issues.  A thorough analysis of Spark’s ability, within an actual clinical setting, to promote SKD could be beneficial.  By studying the IF-SKD model and analyzing Spark, this study extends recently published findings and poses new research questions that provide a better understanding of the use of Spark and the degree to which it can promote serendipitous discoveries within the clinical context.  Purpose of the Study The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the online system Spark using the Information Flow - Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery (IF-SKD) model of information behavior in a clinical setting, developed by Workman, Fiszman, Rindflesch and Nahl (2014).  The IF-SKD model is used to evaluate physicians’ use of Spark, a tool designed to promote serendipitous knowledge discovery (SKD) using both the organization and visualization of semantic relationships derived from the biomedical literature.  The design of Spark was done in consideration of “four core principles of SKD” derived from the information science literature (p. 24). The core principles include: 1) SKD is an iterative process; 2) SKD often involves change or clarification of initial information interests, which may involve integrating new topics; 3) SKD is grounded in the user’s prior knowledge; 4) Information organization and presentation have 6 fundamental roles in SKD.  These principles were also central to the IF-SKD’s development.  A major aim of this study is to explore the utility of the model in representing physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery in a clinical setting.  Definitions The following terms represent key concepts of interest to this research and assist in the understanding of how they are operationalized within the context of the study, as well as providing a general conceptual introduction. • Clinical care setting – In this study, the clinical care setting is purposefully broad and could include a physician’s office, the patient’s room, the physician’s home, the physicians’ lounge(s), or other settings.  Because workflow surrounding the acquisition of information can differ between providers, the goal is not to assume where a serendipitous event should occur, but rather understand how physicians’ information behavior in using Spark correlated to the clinical care setting.   • Information behavior – In the context of this study, information behavior refers to two different aspects.  First, it refers to the historical and studied information seeking behavior, information needs, and gaps encountered by physicians in their information acquisition activities.  Second, it is a reference for the feedback from the questionnaire provided by physician participants regarding their experience with serendipitous knowledge discovery, utilizing Spark and generally.  Together these present an unique viewpoint for how physicians engage in information behavior, and of a specific type of information acquisition relevant to the goals of the study. 7 • Information flow-serendipitous knowledge discovery (IF-SKD) model – An information behavior model, developed by Workman, Fiszman, Rindflesch and Nahl (2014), which outlines the stages of initial information engagement, through the visual representation of retrieved information that supports conceptual short-term memory evaluation, including the iterative clarifications or refinements of that searching, ultimately resulting in knowledge discovery.  Four components underpin this model: 1) SKD is an iterative process; 2) SKD often involves change or clarification of initial information interests, which may involve integrating new topics; 3) SKD is grounded in the user’s prior knowledge; 4) Information organization and presentation have fundamental roles in SKD (Workman, Fiszman, Rindflesch & Nahl 2014). • Physicians (MD/DO) – The population identified for study includes physicians, with Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) credentials, working for the INTEGRIS system.  • Semantic MEDLINE – A project (and resource) created by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) that encompasses the application of natural language processing (NLP) to the identification of semantic predications derived from the MEDLINE database, as well as the use of those semantic predications in other applications; in particular the visual representation of predications to engage users in more effective information seeking behavior and knowledge discovery.  Spark is an application created alongside, and makes use of the underlying aspects of Semantic MEDLINE. • Serendipitous knowledge discovery (SKD) – This refers to the chance, or accidental discovery of new knowledge, where its encountering is done so without this being the express or known information of interest at the time of initial searching/browsing. 8 • Spark – An online system designed to support serendipitous knowledge discovery.  Spark is constructed to support an iterative step process that maximizes users’ conceptual short-term memory (CTSM).  Through an initial search, or topic of interest, the user can refine and visually explore semantic relationships found within the biomedical literature.  Users can adjust the presentation of these relationships using a set of retrieval affordance options by selecting for frequency of occurrence in the literature (rare, common or all), and by relation or concept (e.g. therapy and drugs or chemical). • Spark system factors – These refer to the core components, or features, that make up the Spark application and which is studied as part of this research.  They include:  work space, graph presentation and retrieval affordance mechanisms. o Work space – This is the layout of Spark, in particular, the major left and right pane sections that permit information organization geared to support the CTSM process.  This includes the radial connected graph in the left pane and the saved connections of interest in the right pane. o Graph presentation – This refers to the structure and visual layout of the results from an information search.  The uses of colors and lines, as well as graph type are considered. o Retrieval Affordance Mechanisms – These represent options related to: § Frequency occurrence in the literature:  All, common, rare § Concept type:   Disorder, drugs genes, etc. § Relation type:  Therapy, diagnosis, comorbidity  Research Questions This study addresses two key questions. R1: Does Spark successfully contribute to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery? 9 H1O: Spark does not contribute to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery. R2: Does the IF-SKD model reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting? H2O: The IF-SKD model does not reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting.  Assumptions An important assumption about this study is that there is significant value in the serendipitous discovery of knowledge in the clinical setting.  Another important assumption is that existing tools, and workflow, are unable to induce SKD events meaningfully.  A third assumption is that users within the clinical setting have an interest in facilitating more SKD opportunities and would therefore be strongly vested in providing feedback that would be valuable to the overall interpretation of results.  Limitations  There are several limitations to this study.  For one, it introduces potentially unknown environmental factors that could influence results, such as interruptions due to patient care, participants’ technology familiarity, unknown biases to this type of information behavior among participants, and the study duration.  In selecting to analyze Spark and the IF-SKD model within a context that considers system design aspects and underlying assumptions governing the model, other salient influencing variables could be missed.  While an enhanced understanding of how to operationalize the concept of serendipity, and better measure it, are anticipated products of this study, the concept of serendipity itself 10 remains challenging to convey and measure in practice, and therefore serves as a limitation to the study.  Aspects of this research are grounded in an understanding of the study of SKD to date.  Nonetheless, it remains a challenging aspect of information behavior to measure and therefore could act as a limitation to the effectiveness of the study.  Through analysis of the research methods and instruments used, including their ability to successfully measure SKD, improvements to future research could be possible.  Significance of the Study This study has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the information seeking behavior of physicians.  It provides an opportunity to test a new model of information behavior dealing with the complex topic of serendipitous knowledge discovery.  Likewise, it allows for the assessment of Spark, a new information resource designed in consideration of this model.  Results derived from this study assist in understanding the IF-SKD’s general applicability to a clinical care setting and could spur further targeted research.  Finally, results could serve to improve the field’s overall understanding of serendipitous knowledge discovery and to suggest improvements to Spark that could help physicians and other medical providers in the future, which could in turn lead to improved patient outcomes.  Relevant findings from the study could later be incorporated into the development of new research tools and avenues for future research.  11 Summary of the Chapter The current state of biomedical information is vast and complex.  The study of information behavior models, especially in the clinical care setting, to support serendipitous knowledge discovery is an area where research is needed.  This understanding is paramount to improving the development of future information resources. This research investigates the IF-SKD model’s viability within a clinical environment and what factors contribute to that understanding.  Additionally, it assesses Spark’s system functionality and how it contributes to serendipitous knowledge discovery through the analysis of physician feedback.    The need to continually challenge existing methods of information behavior is important.  This study aims to build upon existing work and to support the development and understanding of information resources that promote serendipitous knowledge discovery.   ","1 chapter 1 introduction introduction and background this research study is conducted to test workman, fiszman, rindflesch and nahl’s (2014) information flow – serendipitous knowledge discovery (if-skd) model of information behavior, in a clinical care context. to date, there have been few attempts to model the serendipitous knowledge discovery of physicians. due to the growth and complexity of the biomedical literature, as well as the increasingly specialized nature of medicine, there is a need for advanced systems that can quickly present information and assist physicians to discover new knowledge. the national library of medicine’s (nlm) lister hill center for biocommunication’s semantic medline project is focused on identifying and visualizing semantic relationships in the biomedical literature to support knowledge discovery. this project led to the development of a new information discovery system, spark. the aim of spark is to promote serendipitous knowledge discovery by assisting users in maximizing the use of their conceptual short-term memory to iteratively search for, engage, clarify and evaluate information presented from the biomedical literature. using spark, this study analyzes the if-skd model by capturing and analyzing physician feedback. the mccay-peet, toms and kelloway’s (2015) perception of serendipity and serendipitous digital environment questionnaires are used. results are evaluated to determine whether spark contributes to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery and the ability of the if-skd ability to capture physicians’ information behavior in a clinical setting 2 the concept, study and application of serendipitous knowledge discovery (skd) are not new to the field of information science. over the years, the idea of discovery through serendipity, or “information encountering” has been studied and understood using a variety of methods with varied outcomes, though some common themes (erdelez, 1997). however, few formal models exist that are derived from information science and its literature. foster and ford (2003) noted that due to serendipity’s “elusive, unpredictable” nature, skd is challenging to understand within existing information behavior models (p. 321). often, technical and psychosocial factors are at the heart of understanding this behavior. intervening variables such as age, education, task, personality, information need, prior knowledge, etc. play a role as well (burkell, quan-hase & rubin, 2012; heinström, 2006; spink, 2004). yet, despite these fundamental complexities, it is paramount that in today’s richly complex information world, the study of serendipitous knowledge discovery remains a priority. the if-skd model is a step in this direction, and its further analysis only aids in its development and refinement. in contrast to the study of skd, physicians’ information behavior is quite rich. because some aspects of clinical workflow, and the often-required information technologies that drive it are process driven, there are numerous studies that review the utility of an array of information resource solutions within those workflows. for example, del fiol et al.

factors contribute to that understanding. additionally, it assesses spark’s system functionality and how it contributes to serendipitous knowledge discovery through the analysis of physician feedback. the need to continually challenge existing methods of information behavior is important. this study aims to build upon existing work and to support the development and understanding of information resources that promote serendipitous knowledge discovery.",1 chapter 1 introduction introduction and background this research study is conducted to test workman fiszman rindflesch and nahl’s 2014 information flow – serendipitous knowledge discovery ifskd model of information behavior in a clinical care context to date there have been few attempts to model the serendipitous knowledge discovery of physicians due to the growth and complexity of the biomedical literature as well as the increasingly specialized nature of medicine there is a need for advanced systems that can quickly present information and assist physicians to discover new knowledge the national library of medicine’s nlm lister hill center for biocommunication’s semantic medline project is focused on identifying and visualizing semantic relationships in the biomedical literature to support knowledge discovery this project led to the development of a new information discovery system spark the aim of spark is to promote serendipitous knowledge discovery by assisting users in maximizing the use of their conceptual shortterm memory to iteratively search for engage clarify and evaluate information presented from the biomedical literature using spark this study analyzes the ifskd model by capturing and analyzing physician feedback the mccaypeet toms and kelloway’s 2015 perception of serendipity and serendipitous digital environment questionnaires are used results are evaluated to determine whether spark contributes to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery and the ability of the ifskd ability to capture physicians’ information behavior in a clinical setting 2 the concept study and application of serendipitous knowledge discovery skd are not new to the field of information science over the years the idea of discovery through serendipity or “information encountering” has been studied and understood using a variety of methods with varied outcomes though some common themes erdelez 1997 however few formal models exist that are derived from information science and its literature foster and ford 2003 noted that due to serendipity’s “elusive unpredictable” nature skd is challenging to understand within existing information behavior models p 321 often technical and psychosocial factors are at the heart of understanding this behavior intervening variables such as age education task personality information need prior knowledge etc play a role as well burkell quanhase  rubin 2012 heinström 2006 spink 2004 yet despite these fundamental complexities it is paramount that in today’s richly complex information world the study of serendipitous knowledge discovery remains a priority the ifskd model is a step in this direction and its further analysis only aids in its development and refinement in contrast to the study of skd physicians’ information behavior is quite rich because some aspects of clinical workflow and the oftenrequired information technologies that drive it are process driven there are numerous studies that review the utility of an array of information resource solutions within those workflows for example del fiol et al 2012 and others have shown how context driven infobuttons information have helped meet clinical information needs for years electronic medical records emrs have contained clinical alerting mechanisms designed to provide safety precautions within the use of certain activities such as drug administration when known issues exist that could cause harm such as drug interactions and black box warnings a strong motivation in the literature has been to maximize the utility 3 automation and breadth of content available to physicians and then to study how that content or system was used and whether access to the information impacted their clinical decision making one study explored physicians’ questions within the emr workflow to ascertain the situational factors likely to resolve unmet information needs

et al 2003 these are important topics yet are all predicated on a known or anticipated user information need accounting for the unformed and unknown needs of physicians including how best to model those needs as well as apply them to the design of new tools and system is an area needing further exploration general models of skd that have been developed are relatively new especially in their application to system design and even more particularly in their lack of application to physicians within the clinical setting essential to both physicians’ information behavior and the idea of skd is an understanding of existing information resources and content including the rich taxonomies and controlled vocabularies contributing to it that comprise the biomedical literature within the biomedical information space there are numerous information resources the national library of medicine nlm has been central to the creation and growth of these online databases and resources which offer unique and powerful access to information years of careful and meaningful curation of underlying data has in large part made this possible however for many resources there is the inherent assumption of a goal or known information need by the user only recently have tools been designed to support serendipitous knowledge discovery for 4 situations where a goal or information need is not present or potentially unknown by the user these rich information resources and their underlying metadata provide the ideal springboard from which to build new systems that can promote serendipitous discovery through improved system design the meaningful identification of semantic relationships and the use of information visualization these new tools can assist in modeling an iterative information seeking process that improves not only outcomes but also “reduces the cognitive demands of information organization” by ultimately increasing the chance for serendipitous knowledge discovery workman fiszman rindflesch  nahl 2014 new systems should be built to support skd within the clinical setting the task of future researchers is to better understand how these systems should be examined in order to explain how system design equates with the discipline’s understanding of serendipitous knowledge discovery as a type of information behavior in turn this helps address another major challenge which is the growth and specialization of biomedical information statement of the problem the increased specialization of the medical field along with the enormous growth of biomedical information pose unique challenges for how best to identify present and use information in effective ways within the clinical care setting physicians who can benefit greatly through the consumption and application of relevant information are often challenged with effective ways to discover it systems are just beginning to incorporate skd design principles of those few are effectively integrating rich data structures such as semantic 5 predications with effective visualization and refinement techniques the spark application which is designed based on the recently developed ifskd model provides opportunities to increase moments of serendipitous knowledge discovery at the present time there is no understanding of spark’s efficacy to address these issues a thorough analysis of spark’s ability within an actual clinical setting to promote skd could be beneficial by studying the ifskd model and analyzing spark this study extends recently published findings and poses new research questions that provide a better understanding of the use of spark and the degree to which it can promote serendipitous discoveries within the clinical context purpose of the study the purpose of this research study is to evaluate the online system spark using the information flow  serendipitous knowledge discovery ifskd model of information behavior in a clinical setting developed by workman fiszman rindflesch and nahl 2014 the ifskd model is used to evaluate physicians’ use of spark a tool designed to promote serendipitous knowledge discovery skd using both the organization and visualization of semantic relationships derived from the biomedical literature the design of spark was done in consideration of “four core principles of skd” derived from the information science literature p 24 the core principles include 1 skd is an iterative process 2 skd often involves change or clarification of initial information interests which may involve integrating new topics 3 skd is grounded in the user’s prior knowledge 4 information organization and presentation have 6 fundamental roles in skd these principles were also central to the ifskd’s development a major aim of this study is to explore the utility of the model in representing physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery in a clinical setting definitions the following terms represent key concepts of interest to this research and assist in the understanding of how they are operationalized within the context of the study as well as providing a general conceptual introduction • clinical care setting – in this study the clinical care setting is purposefully broad and could include a physician’s office the patient’s room the physician’s home the physicians’ lounges or other settings because workflow surrounding the acquisition of information can differ between providers the goal is not to assume where a serendipitous event should occur but rather understand how physicians’ information behavior in using spark correlated to the clinical care setting • information behavior – in the context of this study information behavior refers to two different aspects first it refers to the historical and studied information seeking behavior information needs and gaps encountered by physicians in their information acquisition activities second it is a reference for the feedback from the questionnaire provided by physician participants regarding their experience with serendipitous knowledge discovery utilizing spark and generally together these present an unique viewpoint for how physicians engage in information behavior and of a specific type of information acquisition relevant to the goals of the study 7 • information flowserendipitous knowledge discovery ifskd model – an information behavior model developed by workman fiszman rindflesch and nahl 2014 which outlines the stages of initial information engagement through the visual representation of retrieved information that supports conceptual shortterm memory evaluation including the iterative clarifications or refinements of that searching ultimately resulting in knowledge discovery four components underpin this model 1 skd is an iterative process 2 skd often involves change or clarification of initial information interests which may involve integrating new topics 3 skd is grounded in the user’s prior knowledge 4 information organization and presentation have fundamental roles in skd workman fiszman rindflesch  nahl 2014 • physicians mddo – the population identified for study includes physicians with doctor of medicine md or doctor of osteopathic medicine do credentials working for the integris system • semantic medline – a project and resource created by the national library of medicine nlm that encompasses the application of natural language processing nlp to the identification of semantic predications derived from the medline database as well as the use of those semantic predications in other applications in particular the visual representation of predications to engage users in more effective information seeking behavior and knowledge discovery spark is an application created alongside and makes use of the underlying aspects of semantic medline • serendipitous knowledge discovery skd – this refers to the chance or accidental discovery of new knowledge where its encountering is done so without this being the express or known information of interest at the time of initial searchingbrowsing 8 • spark – an online system designed to support serendipitous knowledge discovery spark is constructed to support an iterative step process that maximizes users’ conceptual shortterm memory ctsm through an initial search or topic of interest the user can refine and visually explore semantic relationships found within the biomedical literature users can adjust the presentation of these relationships using a set of retrieval affordance options by selecting for frequency of occurrence in the literature rare common or all and by relation or concept eg therapy and drugs or chemical • spark system factors – these refer to the core components or features that make up the spark application and which is studied as part of this research they include work space graph presentation and retrieval affordance mechanisms o work space – this is the layout of spark in particular the major left and right pane sections that permit information organization geared to support the ctsm process this includes the radial connected graph in the left pane and the saved connections of interest in the right pane o graph presentation – this refers to the structure and visual layout of the results from an information search the uses of colors and lines as well as graph type are considered o retrieval affordance mechanisms – these represent options related to § frequency occurrence in the literature all common rare § concept type disorder drugs genes etc § relation type therapy diagnosis comorbidity research questions this study addresses two key questions r1 does spark successfully contribute to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery 9 h1o spark does not contribute to physicians’ serendipitous knowledge discovery r2 does the ifskd model reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting h2o the ifskd model does not reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting assumptions an important assumption about this study is that there is significant value in the serendipitous discovery of knowledge in the clinical setting another important assumption is that existing tools and workflow are unable to induce skd events meaningfully a third assumption is that users within the clinical setting have an interest in facilitating more skd opportunities and would therefore be strongly vested in providing feedback that would be valuable to the overall interpretation of results limitations there are several limitations to this study for one it introduces potentially unknown environmental factors that could influence results such as interruptions due to patient care participants’ technology familiarity unknown biases to this type of information behavior among participants and the study duration in selecting to analyze spark and the ifskd model within a context that considers system design aspects and underlying assumptions governing the model other salient influencing variables could be missed while an enhanced understanding of how to operationalize the concept of serendipity and better measure it are anticipated products of this study the concept of serendipity itself 10 remains challenging to convey and measure in practice and therefore serves as a limitation to the study aspects of this research are grounded in an understanding of the study of skd to date nonetheless it remains a challenging aspect of information behavior to measure and therefore could act as a limitation to the effectiveness of the study through analysis of the research methods and instruments used including their ability to successfully measure skd improvements to future research could be possible significance of the study this study has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the information seeking behavior of physicians it provides an opportunity to test a new model of information behavior dealing with the complex topic of serendipitous knowledge discovery likewise it allows for the assessment of spark a new information resource designed in consideration of this model results derived from this study assist in understanding the ifskd’s general applicability to a clinical care setting and could spur further targeted research finally results could serve to improve the field’s overall understanding of serendipitous knowledge discovery and to suggest improvements to spark that could help physicians and other medical providers in the future which could in turn lead to improved patient outcomes relevant findings from the study could later be incorporated into the development of new research tools and avenues for

information needs and gaps encountered by physicians in their information acquisition activities second it is a reference for the feedback from the questionnaire provided by physician participants regarding their experience with serendipitous knowledge discovery utilizing spark and generally together these present an unique viewpoint for how physicians engage in information behavior and of a specific type of information acquisition relevant to the goals of the study  information flowserendipitous knowledge discovery ifskd model an information behavior model developed by workman fiszman rindflesch and nahl  which outlines the stages of initial information engagement through the visual representation of retrieved information that supports conceptual shortterm memory evaluation including the iterative clarifications or refinements of that searching ultimately resulting in knowledge discovery four components underpin this model  skd is an iterative process  skd often involves change or clarification of initial information interests which may involve integrating new topics  skd is grounded in the user s prior knowledge  information organization and presentation have fundamental roles in skd workman fiszman rindflesch nahl  physicians mddo the population identified for study includes physicians with doctor of medicine md or doctor of osteopathic medicine do credentials working for the integris system semantic medline a project and resource created by the national library of medicine nlm that encompasses the application of natural language processing nlp to the identification of semantic predications derived from the medline database as well as the use of those semantic predications in other applications in particular the visual representation of predications to engage users in more effective information seeking behavior and knowledge discovery spark is an application created alongside and makes use of the underlying aspects of semantic medline serendipitous knowledge discovery skd this refers to the chance or accidental discovery of new knowledge where its encountering is done so without this being the express or known information of interest at the time of initial searchingbrowsing  spark an online system designed to support serendipitous knowledge discovery spark is constructed to support an iterative step process that maximizes users conceptual shortterm memory ctsm through an initial search or topic of interest the user can refine and visually explore semantic relationships found within the biomedical literature users can adjust the presentation of these relationships using a set of retrieval affordance options by selecting for frequency of occurrence in the literature rare common or all and by relation or concept eg therapy and drugs or chemical spark system factors these refer to the core components or features that make up the spark application and which is studied as part of this research they include work space graph presentation and retrieval affordance mechanisms o work space this is the layout of spark in particular the major left and right pane sections that permit information organization geared to support the ctsm process this includes the radial connected graph in the left pane and the saved connections of interest in the right pane o graph presentation this refers to the structure and visual layout of the results from an information search the uses of colors and lines as well as graph type are considered o retrieval affordance mechanisms these represent options related to frequency occurrence in the literature all common rare concept type disorder drugs genes etc relation type therapy diagnosis comorbidity research questions this study addresses two key questions r does spark successfully contribute to physicians serendipitous knowledge discovery  ho spark does not contribute to physicians serendipitous knowledge discovery r does the ifskd model reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting ho the ifskd model does not reflect physician serendipitous knowledge discovery information behavior in the clinical care setting assumptions an important assumption about this study is that there is significant value in the serendipitous discovery of knowledge in the clinical setting another important assumption is that existing tools and workflow are unable to induce skd events meaningfully a third assumption is that users within the clinical setting have an interest in facilitating more skd opportunities and would therefore be strongly vested in providing feedback that would be valuable to the overall interpretation of results limitations there are several limitations to this study for one it introduces potentially unknown environmental factors that could influence results such as interruptions due to patient care participants technology familiarity unknown biases to this type of information behavior among participants and the study duration in selecting to analyze spark and the ifskd model within a context that considers system design aspects and underlying assumptions governing the model other salient influencing variables could be missed while an enhanced understanding of how to operationalize the concept of serendipity and better measure it are anticipated products of this study the concept of serendipity itself  remains challenging to convey and measure in practice and therefore serves as a limitation to the study aspects of this research are grounded in an understanding of the study of skd to date nonetheless it remains a challenging aspect of information behavior to measure and therefore could act as a limitation to the effectiveness of the study through analysis of the research methods and instruments used including their ability to successfully measure skd improvements to future research could be possible significance of the study this study has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the information seeking behavior of physicians it provides an opportunity to test a new model of information behavior dealing with the complex topic of serendipitous knowledge discovery likewise it allows for the assessment of spark a new information resource designed in consideration of this model results derived from this study assist in understanding the ifskd s general applicability to a clinical care setting and could spur further targeted research finally results could serve to improve the field s overall understanding of serendipitous knowledge discovery and to suggest improvements to spark that could help physicians and other medical providers in the future which could in turn lead to improved patient outcomes relevant findings from the study could later be incorporated into the development of new research tools and avenues for future research  summary of the chapter the current state of biomedical information is vast and complex the study of information behavior models especially in the clinical care setting to support serendipitous knowledge discovery is an area where research is needed this understanding is paramount to improving the development of future information resources this research investigates the ifskd model s viability within a clinical environment and what factors contribute to that understanding additionally it assesses spark s system functionality and how it contributes to serendipitous knowledge discovery through the analysis of physician feedback the need to continually challenge existing methods of information behavior is important this study aims to build upon existing work and to support the development and understanding

3,"1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT 1.1 Subject Area 1.1.1 Importance of Social Media Research Web-based social networking is in a general sense changing the way we interact, team up, appropriate, and create. They signify the most effective change driven results of information technology on businesses impacted by professional and personal lives of the stakeholders (Aral, Dellarocas, & Godes, 2013). Social networking is a ubiquitous phenomenon. It has percolated not only the personal lives of its users but it has also impacted the professional domains thereby making its way in to the main stream business discipline. Enforced public visibility is the direct consequences of the Omni-evolving appropriation of social media.  An example of user being forced to use social media can be an online job portal like LinkedIn or Facebook that helps people to stay connected with their friends and families. Recent studies indicate that people have started appropriating social media in aiding their businesses (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010b; Kärkkäinen, Jussila, & Väisänen, 2010; Treem & Leonardi, 2013). Dutta (2010) argues that every businessperson must now have a personal social media strategy. Today’s leaders must embrace social media for three reasons. First they provide a low-cost platform on which to build your personal brand, communicating who you are both within and outside your company. Second they allow you to engage rapidly and simultaneously with peers, employees, customers, and the broader public, especially younger generations in the same transparent and direct way they expect from everyone in their lives. Third they give you an opportunity to learn from instant information and unvarnished feedback. (Dutta, 2010, p. 2)  Research in social media includes investigating activities of its users and the level of those investigations. Aral et al. (2013) classifies areas of activities in to four broad  2 categories namely: “design and features, strategy and tactics, management & organization, and measurement & value at three levels namely: consumers and society, Platforms and intermediaries, and firms and industries” (Aral et al., 2013, p. 4). I am addressing the problem domain that broadly considers intersection of design & features of social media analyzed at the level of and platforms and intermediaries. Research associated with design and features includes investigating the appropriation of features of social networking by different stakeholders such as individuals in social context, and individuals in context of business users. This category depicts how patrons, companies, and governments use explicit social media features and how these technologies are made available to the users. At the same time design research also considers how constrains can be enforced to prevent misappropriation of the same features. Thus design looks in to standardizing and regulating the various facets of social media development and implementation. Individuals, businesses, or governments are the users of social media, which constitutes platforms and intermediaries that continuously, innovate and grow using the platform of social media such as Twitter, Facebook etc. Aral et al. (2013) have listed some of the research agendas, which lie in the intersection of my research domain of interest. They are:   • How can users optimize their use of social media?  • Which objectives do users pursue in using social media?  • How can users create relationships, curate information, broaden their reach, and maximize their influence? • What are the benefits and risks associated with use of social media?  • What is the nonmonetary value that social media create (e.g., equality, health, violence, civic engagement)?   3 • How do specific features and designs help platforms attract users, create engagement, enable and constrain user behavior, and increase revenue? • How can platforms maximize their influence and revenue?  • Should platforms be open or closed, standardized or ad hoc? (Aral et al., 2013) Process of social interactions is complex and governed by societal norms. Social media features are designed and developed in such a way that they enforce constraints on the user behavior to conform to the societal norms. Social media thus exhibit candid impact on the societal framework (Aral et al., 2013). Social media is the futuristic phenomenon intricately associated with human behavior and in the emerging era of the Internet of things, its understanding has become critical for new directions in development of technologies. One of the emerging trends of the appropriation of social media includes the talent acquisition process where companies have started appropriating social networks to track talent to match to the open positions (Aral et al., 2013). LinkedIn is one such example, where a service that began as a job portal emerged in to a social media where the jobseekers do not have to pay for registration and create a profile. Garg and Telang (2011) reported that “features in LinkedIn, such as connections, which can either be further, classified as weak or strong serves different purposes. Weak ties help the individual to come across a job lead while the strong ties and first connection helps an individual to get job interview as well as job offer” (Garg & Telang, 2011).  The site slowly developed to include features that encouraged the Job seekers to update much more information than just their resume. The features of endorsing skills which essentially is a part of social network analysis is appropriated by the employers to gather much more information about the candidate to be able to perform a close fit of the talent to the open positions. Premium services are created both for the job seekers and the employers.  4 Hence it is thus seen that many job portals have emerged in to becoming social networking sites, the concept being social networking encourages users to upload much more social information in context of the talent acquisition. This makes more information available to both the parties the job seekers and the employers. On one hand jobseekers gain more information such as average salaries that a position can command, best working conditions, perks and benefits and so on. On the other hand the employers can gather much more information about the candidate apart, which gives them the ability to match the right candidate to the right job. This kind of appropriation has transformed the job portals into something much more giving the service providers competitive edge (W. Kim, Jeong, & Lee, 2010; Schwartz, 2013). Evolution of social media in this direction gives rise to the considerations that users can use to strategically position themselves on the social media in order to realize their goals pertaining to their career choices. Research in social media and social networking is still in its embryonic stage and is emerging.  The above research has introduced my specific area of research interest in the information related phenomenon that is observed in the emergence of social media. The above section also leads us to finding out why social networking is an area of interest under the discipline of information sciences.    1.1.2 Social Networking in Context of Impression Management  Social networking sites have been a focus of empirical research and have been studied from the perspective of impression management in various interdisciplinary studies such as psychology, sociology, computer-mediated communications etc.    5 Rosenberg and Egbert (2011) studied the utility of personality traits and secondary goals as predictors of self-presentation tactics employed by Facebook users. Secondary goals are recurring motivations in an individual’s life and include identity goals, interaction goals, personal resource goals, and arousal management goals  (Dillard, Segrin, & Harden, 1989). Rosenberg and Egbert reported that individual personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals and that secondary goals predicted the use of various self-presentation tactics used on Facebook. Results indicated that these personality traits and secondary goals are both theoretically and empirically sound components for the conceptualization of online impression management (Rosenberg & Egbert, 2011). This study prompts further research in self presentation on Facebook considering the effect of audience segmentation and how individuals deal with problems of multiple audiences having access to their profile and being witnesses to their activity on Facebook, such as friends versus family members (Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006; Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2007; Stutzman, 2006). For instance, a child may experience uncertainty when parent would want to be added to the child’s Facebook page. The child may not want the parent to view his/or her Facebook page. I have engaged this theme in my research essay where I investigated factors affecting online behavior of people living with HIV and AIDS on Facebook where one of the construct I have looked at is the selective disclosure in context of stigma faced by people living with HIV.  Allbright (2002) conducted a study to investigate relationship formation over computer mediated communication channels. Contrary to notion where physical proximity and cues such as eye contact, body language, etc. have been seen as critical to the  6 formation of attraction, this study investigates how relationships are formed online without physical proximity and cues. A popular belief about online profiles is that people are more likely to construct false profiles with respect to their true age, class, and even gender.  Using Goffman's theory of impression management and literature on deception in communication, this study compared the first impression people formed online with the ""second impression"" formed offline, and the reason for any disparity in the two impressions. Albright reported that most people were honest with each other online, and the majority of participants reported being as or more attracted to their online lovers with increased information via phone calls, photos exchanged and face to face meetings. Most mis-impressions in these relationships were the result of respondents ""filling in the blanks"" incorrectly, or idealization, rather than being victims of overt deception. Albright gives direction for future research in three areas. She points out that not much research has been conducted in the areas of projection and idealization.  Secondly she urges the researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate if these relationships are more viable long term than those formed in face-to-face contexts. And lastly, Albright recommends that further investigations are needed to assess why some relationships never move out of the online environment to a face-to-face meeting (Albright, 2002). Using Albrights themes one area that I have looked in to is the invisibility issue face by communities of people living with HIV and AIDS in context of the stigma associated with the disease. I have looked at solution space for people having concerns about disclosing their identities to use SNS as a platform to be able to meet other people living with HIV with the aim of forming long-term relationships in my research study titled benefits and  7 risks associated with using secret Facebook support group for people living with HIV and AIDS.  SNSs constitute an important research context for scholars investigating processes of impression management, self-presentation, and friendship performance. In one of the earliest academic articles on SNSs, Boyd (2004) examined Friendster as a locus of publicly articulated social networks that allowed users to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others (Donath & Boyd, 2004). Donath and Boyd (2004) extended this to suggest that ‘‘public displays of connection’’ serve as important identity signals that help people navigate the networked social world, in that an extended network may serve to validate identity information presented in profiles (Donath & Boyd, 2004). In listing user motivations for friending, Boyd (2006) points out that friends on SNSs are “not the same as ‘friends’ in the everyday sense; instead, friends provide context by offering users an imagined audience to guide behavioral norms.”    1.1.3 Social Networking in Context of Cyber Security Within social media research, another problem domain is the cyber security concerns. social media use has been appropriated in industry espionage (Spying and social media: Dos and don’ts for guerrilla marketing in the internet age.2015; Albrecht, 2011; Algarni, Xu, & Chan, 2015; Alge, ; Braun & Esswein, 2013; Braun & Esswein, 2016; Gaff, 2014; Hall, 2010; Hill, 2011a; Hill, 2011b; Judge, 2013; Molok, Ahmad, & Chang, 2011; Nuha & Molok, 2011; Salminen & Degbey, 2015; Villarreal, 2012). Studies have been conducted that investigates identity theft in context of social networking sites. “Participants in social network sites create self-descriptive profiles that include their links  8 to other members, creating a visible network of connections — the ostensible purpose of these sites is to use this network to make friends, dates, and business connections” (Donath & Boyd, 2004, p.71). Consider a case of social climber who can build an impressive résumé by name-dropping of famous people as his friends benefiting from the fact that the listener is unable to verify the authenticity. These connections displayed publicly in social networking sites indicate signals that represent attributes or qualities. For e g. a person who uploads images that displays music studios in back ground and has other famous musicians in the picture along with him signals that probably he belongs to the music industry. Because “ public display of connection implies verification of identity and can be viewed as a signal of the reliability of one’s identity claims  (Donath & Boyd, 2004, p. 73), public display of connections can also help someone else establish that they are you, too” (Donath & Boyd, 2004, p. 76). Participants in social networks make their personal social world information publicly available, which can be appropriated in social engineering attacks by the perpetrators or used by the perpetrators for identity theft.  The rapid growth of social networking sites (SNS) like Facebook or LinkedIn has a dramatic effect on identity theft for two main reasons. Aïmeur and Schőnfeld, (2011) studied identity theft in the context of the Facebook. Their work reported that since Facebook has the largest database that contains qualitative as well as quantitative data on its users’ personal information, perpetrators have found it to be lucrative for conducting identity theft attacks. In 2010, the database of Facebook was compromised, and it was discovered that 1.5 million accounts along with their associated data was available on sale at all time low price of 45 USD per 1000 contacts (""iDefense: 1.5 million facebook accounts for sale,"" 2010). Also, once the user uploads the information in Facebook, the  9 user loses all control over that information There has been ambiguity in the transparency relate to the protection of the privacy of its users and the ownership of the uploaded content on the Facebook.  Another security concern faced my most social networking sites is its registration mechanism. SNSs do not validate the users’ identity with any authentication mechanism, e.g., using driving license or SSN to validate if the user is whom the user says is. Since anybody can create a profile by any name, upload any content to that profile; this can lead to direct identity theft. “Anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages” (Aïmeur & Schőnfeld, 2011, p. 26). Hackers can hack in to legitimate Facebook accounts and collect personal information not only about the user but also collect information about the user's friends and their friends. A second major threat of SNS concerns the registration process. Actually, SNS do not check the identity of the users and anyone can assume any name without control. These procedures could lead directly to identity theft with dire consequences for the reputation of the real persons. Anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages. The theft of legitimate accounts is also easy in SNS and the hackers use the information contained in the profile itself to take possession of it. A last point about SNS is to know in which measure we can trust these systems for the protection of data. Most of these sites are actually free of charge for the users and their only source of income is derived from targeted advertising. The resale or the right of access to personal data for advertisers constitutes an enormous information security breach.  10 1.1.4 Social Networking in Context of Information Science Borko (1968) defines information science (IS) as “that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces that governs the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability.” Borko further says that information science is related to mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, library science, management, and other similar fields and consists of a pure science component which inquires in to the subject without regards to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products (1968). Boyd and Ellison defines social network sites (SNS) as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system (2007). From the above two definitions we see that SNS are web based services, a component included in the Borko’s definition allowing exchange of information as individuals construct profiles and articulate list of other users with whom they establish connections to share their profiles, messages, pictures, in short information.   Wilson (2000) in his work “Human Information Behavior” provides the definition of information seeking behavior.  Information seeking behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal. In the course of seeking, the individual may interact with manual information systems (such as a newspaper or a library), or with computer-based systems (such as the World Wide Web). (Wilson, 2000, p. 49)   11 Ashgar (2015) recognized the popularity of Facebook as a source of information and his work resulted in the development of 23-item scale of information seeking in Facebook (ISFS) that looked at information seeking behavior and other motives such as socialization, entertainment, self-seeking, diversion in Facebook usage. The study involved administering the scale to 150 Facebook users and analysis of the data showed strong reliability of Cronbach’s alpha as 0.89. The study used several self-report measures such as general social media usage, online friendships, Facebook friendships, and social media use integration to obtain a strong construct validity. Validity and reliability support suggests that ISFS (information seeking in Facebook scale) can be used to measure information seeking behavior on social networking sites like Facebook (Asghar, 2015). This research has identified a research gap. It was shown by Junco (2012) that information seeking in Facebook is associated with student engagement or performance indicating that collecting and sharing information through Facebook was a positive predictor of academic performance (GPA) (Junco, 2012). While socialization and time spent on Facebook were negative predictors of GPA, time spent on Facebook was only weakly related to the time spent preparing for class (Asghar, 2015). This implies that there must be another process that must be in play that can relate the relationship between Facebook use and GPA.   1.1.5 Information Science in Context of Impression Management  Impression management (IM), a term originated by Erving Goffman (1959), describes a central aspect of role theory: how individual actors create, maintain, defend, and often enhance their social identities through assumptions, settings, props, and scripts  12 in a play metaphor (Dillard et al., 2000, Goffman 1959, and Schlenker 1980). IM explains the motivations behind complex human interactions and performances. In the age of Information, use and control of information plays a pivotal role in our day to day routine. Impression management controls and regulates the information that people manipulate in order to influence the impressions they form on other people. It’s an activity driven by goals. Shlenker (1980) says that people try to manage impressions of a “person (e.g., self, friends, enemies), object (e.g., a business organization, a gift, a consumer product), event (e.g., a transgression, a task performance), or idea (e.g., pro-life versus pro-choice policies, capitalism versus socialism) through a processes of impression management” (Schlenker, 1980). When people try to manage impressions on others about themselves, the process is termed as Self-presentation. The origins of impression management can be traced back to Erving Goffman (1959) where he uses the metaphor of “world stage” to describe role theory, where every person is an actor and will act their part through social complex interactions and social identities. IM is the goal-directed attempt to influence others’ perceptions about a person, a group, and/or an organization regarding an object or event by providing self-assessed beneficial information in social interactions. The goal for the aforementioned attempt is to gain an advantageous first impression. The motive for this goal is based on the assumption that the target audience’s impressions about the individuals, groups, or organizations become reality of the target audience (Goffman, 1959; Leary & Kowalski, 1990).  On the IM “stage,” the target audience can be either real or imaginary. The impression exists in the subliminal level through socialization and generally does not manifest until the “actor” either succeeds or fails to resonate with the target “audience” and, in turn, the  13 targeted “audience” transforms the performance of the “actor” into the reality of the target “audience.” Figure 1.1.Goffman’s impression management model.  One of the prime concepts in impression management is role constraints. Social roles carry expectations regarding how individuals who occupy those roles are to behave (Sarbin & Allen, 1968). The failure to convey impressions consistent with one's role not only diminishes one's effectiveness in that role, but also in many cases can lead the individual to lose the right to enact that role (Goffman, 1959). Conveying impressions is effectively the communication process requiring that the process needs both sending and receiving of information linking role constraints to the study under information science.  Goffman (1959) provided an insightful analysis of the “role governed nature of self-presentation”. His observations included the analysis of how people behave when they are not in front of their target audience. Goffman notes that in ‘back stage’ i.e., when the target audience is absent, the actor (individuals) will come out of their role- governed acting. The actor will relax. Behaviors will be more ‘regressed’ involving informal dialects or lingo using openly sexual remarks and a kidding attitude (1959, p. 112).  Goffman went on to raise the interesting question of whether ""a backstage gives individuals an opportunity to regress or whether regression, inappropriate occasions that are not socially  14 accepted brings out the ‘regressed’ or back stage behavior (1959, p. 128). Studying user behavior is a domain under the specialty of user theory, which is one of the main sub disciplines in information science (White & McCain, 1998, p. 337).  Impression management finally refers to current or potential social image. Finally, the impressions people try to create are affected both by how they think they are currently regarded by others and by how they think others may perceive them in the future (on the basis of future revelations about them, for example). Public failures and embarrassing events compel people to engage in impressionable strategies designed to counter or repair the damaged image (Goffman, 1955). Information science also includes analytical study of learned literatures and their social contexts (White & McCain, 1998, p. 337). Wilson (2000) describes the intedisciplinarity of information science discipline.  Information science is not the only discipline to be concerned with the user and use of information. Mention has been made earlier of the role of the user requirements phase in the design of computer-based systems, but other disciplines also have an interest from different perspectives. For example, psychological studies of personality have dealt with information processing and cognition. (Wilson, 2000, p. 52)  The above research informs the audience on the connectedness between information science and impression management.   1.1.6 Information Science and Cyber Security 1.1.6.1 Fuzzy Logic (Information Science) and Cyber Security Uncertainty is one of the basic facets of human cognition. The concept of a generalized constraint, and its fundamental premise is that information may be viewed as a generalized constraint. The generalized theory of uncertainty proposed by Zadeh (2005) increases our understanding of the foundations of information and uncertainty  15 .“Uncertainty is linked to information through the concept of granular structure––a concept which plays a key role in human interaction with the real world” (Higashi & Klir, 1982; Zadeh, 1979). Granulation is inescapable in human cognition.  The concept of defining linguistic variables where possible values for the variable ‘age’ could be young, middle-aged, and old entwines with the concept of granularity (Zedeh, 1973). Connection between granulation of attribute and the use of linguistic variable can be explained by the fact that cognitive capabilities of human sensory organs and brain have limited ability to store information. “For example, looking at Monika, I see that she is young but cannot pinpoint her age as a single number (Zadeh, 2005, p .3). The concept of a linguistic variable plays a pivotal role in almost all applications of fuzzy logic (Dubois, Prade, & Yager, 1997; Yager & Filev, 1994). The above research informs the connection between information science and fuzzy networks. Research has progressed on how data is processed at the remote terminal unit level using fuzzy logic and fuzzy-genetic algorithms  (Kumar, Chandna, & Thomas, 2003). Preprocessed data integral to the development of automation substations (p. 1582), revolutionizing automation scenario in power systems  (Thomas, Kumar, & Chandna, 2004) is foundational to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks. Patel, Bhatt, and Graham (2009) report that utility and infrastructure companies use SCADA networks for managing public transportation in a given metropolitan area, typically comprising buses, subways, and elevated trains as well as in transportation of raw materials for manufacturing of electricity, oil, gas and various other commodities (Patel, Bhatt, & Graham, 2009). SCADA networks allow many devices to be operated remotely such as track switches, traffic signals, electric circuit breakers, valves, relays, sensors, and water and gas pumps. Many of these networks that were  16 already implemented in infrastructures were developed with little or no consideration towards security and they thus have become susceptible to being easy targets of attacks by terrorist groups. Kumar et al. further reports that SCADA network are extremely popular in the field of industrial production due to its natural propinquity for its use of Internet and wireless technologies allowing automatic monitoring of remote facilities. “Modern SCADA networks, integrated with corporate networks and the Internet, have become far more vulnerable to unauthorized cyber-attacks” (Patel et al., 2009, p. 131).  1.1.6.2 Security as a Function of Information Asymmetries In a Nobel Prize winning work, economist George Akerlof in 1984 discuss markets with asymmetric information. “Akerlof showed informational asymmetries could produce adverse selection in market. Asymmetric information is a common feature of market interactions” (as cited in Lofgren, Persson, & Weibull, 2002, p. 196). With respect to quality of the products, seller often is better informed than the buyer. In case of security products, Security product vendor’s projects often try to market the capabilities of their products. Software security returns on investment are often intangible. “ROI is the present value of accumulated net benefits over a certain time period, divided by the initial costs of investments” (Jerman-Blažič, 2008, p. 418). In case of information security, cost can easily be computed, as it is the cost of the information security products and the cost of operations. Benefits of implementing security measures are intangible. “It is very difficult to define, assess or measure the benefits. Firewalls, IDS, antivirus software and other security solutions do not generate revenue that can be measured” (Jerman-Blažič, 2008, p. 418). Prior research indicates, “the benefits resulting from information security  17 investment are measured as cost savings that result from preventing information security breaches (Gordon & Loeb, 2006). The vendors know that the buyers will not be able to assess the benefits and often get away with quoting high prices for the security products. Since buyers are not able to trust the vendor’s claims, buyers are disinclined in high investments in security measures. Vendors are thus disinclined to invest in development of high quality security products (Anderson & Moore, 2006). The seller of a good often knows more about its quality than the prospective buyer. The job applicant typically knows more about his ability than his potential employer (Lofgren, Persson, & Weibull, 2002). Because buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for quality they cannot measure, buyers often determines the prices they are willing to pay. At those prices, sellers are only able to offer low quality products. The software market suffers from the same information asymmetry.  When personal information will be used in privacy decision-making and how it would be used is knowledge only amongst subset of the decision makers leads to privacy violations caused by asymmetric information. Incomplete information affects privacy decisions (Acquisti & Grossklags, 2005, p. 27). Privacy breaches can occur when people benefits from transactions using a third person’s personal information without that person being a part of that transaction (Varian, 1997). Asymmetrical information also occurs since benefits occurring from taking privacy protecting measures cannot be measured (‘deterministic’) and uncertain, since benefits may be stochastic and rely on other new arbitrary distributions (Acquisti & Grossklags, 2005, p 27). Acquisti further say that people have tendency to take decisions that favor immediate gratifications even if they know that the decision may be hurt them in the long run. An example of this would be a student (on  18 limited income) deciding to install a free antivirus software with limited capabilities. Benefits associated with protection against privacy intrusion are often recognized only after the privacy violations have taken place. If the damage involves financial loss which can be quantified, it becomes easy to see the benefits that could have prevented the damage by implementing protection measures. But often these benefits are more complex, multifaceted and are context specific. This research informs the audience the connection between security as a function of information that makes it an area of investigation under the discipline of information sciences.   1.2 Introduction to the Problem Statement 1.2.1 Positive Online Leads to Positive Offline Behavior  Research and practice indicate that computer users, including Internet users, generally mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior (Yee, Bailenson, & Ducheneaut, 2009). In fact, this robust online-offline relationship is a fundamental tenet of computer training, which anticipates that online training of positive concepts and activities should reinforce positive offline beliefs and performance (Eastmond, 1995a; Matthews, 1999; Moore & Kearsley, 2011; Robst, 2007; Vrasidas, 2000). Surprisingly, relatively little research has focused on the relationship between negative online and negative offline behaviors.   1.2.2 Negative Online Leads to Negative Offline Behavior Training reinforces many behaviors (Konijn, 2000), but it is the training context that determines whether the reinforcement effects are positive or negative. Negative  19 behaviors are those that can have an adverse effect on the well-being and performance of those who were the target (Burnes & Pope, 2007). This research focuses on the dark side of the training relationship, suggesting that online training of negative concepts and activities should likewise reinforce negative offline beliefs and performance.  Negative behaviors are those that border on incivility, aggression, violence (Pearson, Andersson, & Wegner, 2001). Impetuous behavior is defined as behavior with negative connotation, which is characterized with people acting on a sudden idea without considering the results of their actions (“Urban Dictionary: impetuous,” 2016). It also means reckless or irresponsible behavior (Meltzer, 2005). This study also considers impetuous behaviors to include risqué behaviors  that are sexually-suggestive behaviors which can border on being  uncivil (sexual harassment), rude, insensitive (sexual advances), and disrespectful (P. Brown & Levinson, 1987).  Table 1.1  Type of Behaviors Behaviors Online Offline Impetuous Risqué: (sexually suggestive) sexting, Flaming (sending rude messages, Cussing), Posting suggestive images FtF:  flirting Risky (dangerous) On-line trading, online-espionage, Cyber-attacks Hackers. Cyber thefts. High-risk sexual behavior (Multiple partners), ftf street fights, competitive car racing. National security attacks, Social engineering.   20 1.2.3 Continuous or Almost Obsessive Compulsive Use of the Internet  PIU (problematic Internet use ) may lead to online automatic behavior (Goldberg, 1995; Neal, Wood, & Quinn, 2006), which can translate in to second nature (Konijn, 2000),which the users may mimic in the offline environment (McKenna & Green, 2002).  It is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior (Neal et al., 2006).  Therefore, research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highly-undesirable offline behavior and even tragic results (“Jessica Logan,” 2015, “Ryan Halligan: The Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Megan Meier Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Story of Tyler Clementi,” 2015). Thus this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems  1.2.4 The Problem of Inadequate Parental Internet Supervision and Control Inadequate parental supervision and control of children’s online behavior (Morrongiello, Kane, & Zdzieborski, 2011; Morrongiello, Read, et al., 2011) contributes to negative offline behavior.  Previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the Internet activity of their children, including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children; therefore they exert little supervisory control over the Internet activity of their children (Morrongiello, Kane, et al., 2011). This demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior (Newcomb & Loeb, 1999). Substance use, violent behavior, early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults are some of the negative behaviors (Beets et al., 2009). Bullying others at workplace (Burnes & Pope, 2007) is extension of  negative aggressive behaviors. Other negative behaviors include truancy, bullying,  21 insubordination, disrespect, tardiness, fighting, stealing, and vandalism (P. Brown & Levinson, 1987).  Another factor that influences the onset of problematic online behavior in young Internet users is largely attributable to inadequate parental supervision and control over their offspring (Morrongiello, Kane, & Zdzieborski, 2011; Morrongiello, Read, et al., 2011). Previous research shows that  many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the Internet activity of their children, including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children; therefore they exert little supervisory control over the Internet activity of their children (Morrongiello, Kane, et al., 2011). This demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior (Newcomb & Loeb, 1999).  Games and simulation overlap (aircraft simulators, math games, spelling games) are designed to help students so that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set effects in enhancing, grasping, learning a talent set or a conduct (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993). Previous research indicates that games provide effective motivational learning environments (Trevino et al., 2016) and can be designed to target specific contents of the subject matter (Randel, Morris, & Wetzel, 1992). Simulation techniques are helpful to train the students achieve accuracy in low frequency events such as emergency landing procedures and processes that have irreversible outputs such as surgical procedures (Damassa & Sitko, 2010).  Parenting behavior is bi-dimensional support conduct that characterizes parental attitude towards their children (Hoeve et al., 2009). Positive support occurs when children experience parental warmth, acceptance, approval and responsiveness to their needs (Maccoby & Martin, 1983; Rohner, 2004). Similarly, negative support occurs when  22 children experience parental hostility, insensitivity, lack of communication and intimacy, neglect and rejection ( Hoeve et al., 2009; Holden, 1997; Maccoby & Martin, 1983; Rohner, 2004; Rollins & Thomas, 1979).  At home, parents today are providing less child-rearing guidance for their children than their own parents provided them (Baumrind, 1971; Zervides, 2007). This is evident in the findings of study conducted by Zervide and Knoles (2007) which shows that there has been a trend of changes of parental rearing styles from authoritarian to authoritative to more lenient and democratic styles (Zervides, 2007).  Prior research has indicated those young teenagers who regard ‘parental rearing behaviors’ as being over- meddling, disciplinary, and lacking in approachability, has led to the problematic use of the internet in the youth suggesting that the influences of parenting style and family function are important factors in the development of Internet dependency (Mengchen & Med, 2010).  Previous research in context to the children sustaining injuries show that many children today have access to private bedrooms (Jiow & Lim, 2012; Olson et al., 2007), often spent considerable amount of their awake time unsupervised and unmonitored and that lessened control is often linked with increased children’s risky behaviors (Harrell, 2003; Morrongiello, Corbett, McCourt, & Johnston, 2006; Morrongiello, Kane, et al., 2011). Such children are also likely to have access to such genres of video games that are most likely to be violent and matured content (Jiow & Lim, 2012; Olson et al., 2007). The reasons for this could be that parents face many challenges in monitoring and supervising children because todays contemporary parents have to juggle their personal, professional life often facing adversity in face of magnifying ‘social-isolation’ and their various social professional and family commitments (“Parenting Today,” n.d.). These  23 challenges include limitations affecting their ability to continuously monitor children playing together or alone, both which include playing video games (Livingstone, 2007; Livingstone & Helsper, 2008; Nikken & Jansz, 2006). For example, single parents or those who are time-constrained are more likely to allow video and computer games to “baby sit” their children—keeping them engaged, indoors, and occupied—but unsupervised (Cauchon, 2005; Harms & Clifford, 1989; Wilson-Doenges, 2001; Worley, 2011). Such time-constrained parents have self-reported that they lack time and technical expertise to understand video games and are more than likely to stop monitoring and supervision over period of time, as they perceive their children to possess superior technical expertise to their own (Oosting, IJsselsteijn, & Kort, 2008). Parents have also rationalized their indifference toward inappropriate content in video games because they believe that their children are unaffected by these games (“Violent video games and young people,” 2008). According to Pro Cons ,videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes  carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres (“Charts Graphs on Video Games -Youth Violence,” 2015).

Children lack control supervision and monitoring not only at home but they may also face similar circumstances at schools where lack of supervision, monitoring and guidance would impact children to behave risqué in school environment. In pre-Internet society, parents exercised a more dominant role in raising their children and instilling values (Comer, 1993; Gillies, 2008; Grusec, 2002). But in contemporary society with many parents working, as parents provide less guidance for their children at home, research indicates that more parents throughout the world harbor an expectation that schools assume that dominant role—in teaching, supervising, and mentoring children’s’ behavior (Dinham & Scott, 2000). At school, parents today expect more child-rearing guidance be provided for their children than their schools provided them (Grolnick, Friendly, & Bellas, 2009; Steinberg, Lamborn, Dornbusch, & Darling,  25 1992; Usher & Kober, 2012; Zervides, 2007). Parents thus harbor expectations from the schools to provide the necessary supervision to their children. Although parents still want their children to mature into responsible citizens, in the contemporary societies, parents expect the school authorities to assume most of the responsibility towards this goal expecting the schools to do most of the work associated with imparting knowledge as well as values (Comer, 1993; Delattre & Delattre, 2005). However parents are reluctant to allow schools to take disciplinary actions against their children (Barge & Loges, 2003; Ferrara & Ferrar, 2005; Georgiou, 2008). As a result of this school children are often likely to receive little or no discipline what so ever (Ferrara & Ferrar, 2005). School environments thus are often less effective in fulfilling the expectation of contemporary parents in the area of being able to teach basic values to their children and thus are ineffective in fulfilling the expectation of the society in large (Edmonds, 1979; McEvoy & Welker, 2000; Olweus, 1994). Lack of disciplinary actions from school authorities can lead to increase in disruptive behaviors in school (Nelson, Martella, & Galand, 1998). Studies also have indicated students have engaged in menacing actions, including stalking, bullying, physical or verbal assaults, and “hijacking” classrooms (Kuhlenschmidt & Layne, 1999; Schneider, 1998), which makes understanding this behavior important  in context  to our research. Overall, sociologists and legal authorities indicate that contemporary children receive less than adequate disciplinary guidance or supervision at home or at school (Ferrara & Ferrar, 2005; Pang, 2009).  There is yet another dimension to the disruptive behaviors of the children that is seen in public situations. Less than adequate child rearing guidance at home and school is likely to influence children’s behavior in the society that can impact the citizens of the  26 society at large (Ferrara & Ferrar, 2005; Pang, 2009). Kelly ( 2007) reported in New York Times  an issue that exemplified disruptive and unruly behavior in a public library in New Jersey community (Kelly, 2007) Every afternoon at Maplewood Middle School’s final bell, dozens of students pour across Baker Street to the public library. Some study quietly. Others, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. One recently threatened to burn down the branch library. Librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day. (Kelly, 2007)  Another example is acquisition of certain behavior traits which are deemed necessary for survival on the streets and characterizes greater approval of the use of violence, more pronounced aggression, use of rough language and tendency to ridicule parental and school authority which is popularly known as street corner sub culture (Chilman, 1965; Crain & Weisman, 1972; Hanna, 1988).  Child in Need of Services (CHINS), enacted in multiple states in the U.S., is defined by law as a child that is consistently absent from school, consistently disobey reasonable directions of his or her parents and teachers, is fugitive, Wanders or loiters about the streets, highway, or any public place, and does something wrong (Wolf & Larrick, 2012).Such a child is believed to be beyond the control of the parental guidance and direction and such behavior endangers the health, safety and welfare of the child (Wolf & Larrick, 2012).  Undiagnosed ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) can also lead to children behaving in such a way that could be constituted as disruptive (Hallowell, n.d.). Studies thus indicates that such children whose disruptive behavioral traits at large go unchecked by the guiding influences in their lives are likely to developing learning  27 difficulties, school problems, peer relationship difficulties, criminality and more severe and long-lasting mental disorders (Joachim, Sanders, & Turner, 2010).  1.2.5 Uninhibited Online Behavior Another concern that is important from the context of this study is the uninhibited online behavior that may have implications on people’s offline behavior. Research indicates that, especially with teenagers, online behavior typically is less inhibited and restrained than offline behavior. Uninhibited online behavior lead from on-line risqué behavior to off-line risky behavior in impressionable young students (Joseph M Kayany, 1998).  Online smart phone dating applications like Tinder, Grindr, Growlr, Scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers (Woo, 2015). Thus online risqué behavior is translated in to offline risky behavior. Teenagers often exhibit uninhibited online behavior, which is referred to as ‘Flaming behavior’ and is defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability”(Joseph M Kayany, 1998). Reasons are that these activities are frequently 1) Invisible (as with monitoring by parents or law enforcement) (Cauchon, 2005; Harms & Clifford, 1989; Wilson-Doenges, 2001; Worley, 2011), 2) Simulated (as with violent games) (Bartholow & Anderson, 2002; “Charts Graphs on Video Games -Youth Violence,” 2015; Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, 2004;  28 Griffiths, 1999), 3) un-attributable (as with unauthorized information or image sharing) (Hu, Zhang, & Luo, 2016; Kim, Lee, Sung, & Choi, 2016; Moncur, Orzech, & Neville, 2016; Silic & Back, 2016), and 4) And indirect (as with avoiding personal responsibility) (Derlega & Chaikin, 1975). Uninhibited online behavior can lead to online risqué behavior that can lead to offline risky behavior. For example Internet addiction disorder that can lead to obsessive-compulsive use of the Internet can influence transitioning of on-line risqué behavior to off-line risky behavior in impressionable young students.   1.2.6 Desirable and Undesirable Outcomes Resulting from Online Behavior Students using excessive Internet can have desirable effects that can include information seeking, cognitive training, resulting in individuals becoming independent as well as allowing advancement of career and social connections. Desirable outcomes of second nature and formation of automatic behavior from practice and drill use of the Internet can be associated with the outcomes that assist offline cognitive decision making and physical performance, including distance education from grade school to post graduate levels, professional training, and behavioral modification (Eastmond, 1995a, 1995b; Matthews, 1999; Moore & Kearsley, 2011; Robst, 2007; Vrasidas, 2000) Students using excessive Internet can result in adverse effects. Individuals can experience online influence of undesirable behaviors, which is common in games, blogs, instant messaging, texting, etc. (Chalfen, 2009; Günsoy, Cross, Sarıbay, Olcaysoy Ökten, & Kurutaş, 2015; Peluchette & Karl, 2010; Shah, 2010). Previous cross sectional study that investigated students excessive internet usage reveals that adverse effects include anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), extreme personality  29 traits, alcohol abuse (Weinstein & Lejoyeux, 2010).  Previous studies have indicated that students experiencing higher level of anxiety are more likely to experience higher levels of apathy, feeling of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness(Sashittal, Jassawalla, & Markulis, 2012). Fave and Massimini (2005) defines Apathy as “the lack of attention, concentration, and control leading to disruption in consciousness and to the waste of psychic resources and skills,”(Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005).  Jassawala et al. ( 2008) describes social disconnectedness as the  extent to which students experiences  disengagement, loneliness, and distance from their peers in their  social environment (Jassawalla, Malshe, & Sashittal, 2008). Another effect of excessive Internet leads to low academic performance (Huang et al., 2009; Park, Kang, & Kim, 2014), which was also the effect on students that got bored  with increased magnitude and frequency and sought sensation seeking activities on the Internet (Skues, Williams, Oldmeadow, & Wise, 2016; Yang, Zhu, Chen, Song, & Wang, 2016).  These students have unlimited access to fantasy games and different tools that can keep the imaginations and adrenaline constantly charged (Allison, Wahlde, & Shockley, 2006; Asgari & Kaufman, 2004; Holtz & Appel, 2011; Silvern & Williamson, 1987; Allison et al., 2006). Using the appropriate technological tools available to them, young adolescents can talk about their fantasies in blogs, social medias, and communicate these ideas and fantasies with their peers (Allison et al., 2006). Studies have also reported that excessive internet use has resulted in shorter sleep duration resulting in sleep deprivation, exhaustion, and ill health (Do, Shin, Bautista, & Foo, 2013). Excessive Internet use has also caused adverse effects on student’s dietary behavior (Yeonsoo Kim et al., 2010), partner interaction anxiety (Odac & Kalkan,  30 2010), greater  probabilities  of suicidal ideation and attempt (Yeonsoo Kim et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014) Undesired behavior also can be observed in young students when they exhibit confrontational behaviors in the classroom resulting in disruption of the class discipline (Kitishat & Al-Friehat, 2013). Disruption in class room can include students playing video games and when confronted for their activities becoming hostile (Ali & Gracey, 2013, p. 2; Hubbell, 2010, p. 1). Pathological Internet use has significant correlations with depression (75%), anxiety (57%), ADHD symptoms (100%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (66%) and aggression (66%). Pathological Internet use is more common in males than in females (Sinkkonen, Puhakka, & Meriläinen, 2014). Cyber bullying has been described as chronic damage inflicted via the usage of computer systems and other digital devices (Hinduja & Patchin, 2011).  This conduct can include harassing messages, derogatory feedback on a web website online, or intimidating or threatening someone in diverse on-line settings of public boards, video games, blogs, or social networking web sites (Burgess-Proctor, Patchin, & Hinduja, 2009). Previous research in keeping with Wegge et al. (2014) reveals that “digital forms of bullying often take place among people who know one another in actual lifestyles, together with schoolmates, implying that they'll be concerned in more than one varieties of social in addition to bullying interactions”(Wegge, Vandebosch, & Eggermont, 2014, p. 428 ). As indicated by McKenna et al. (2002), teenagers and young adults, often mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior, this means that it is likely that cyber bullying also influences traditional bullying, and such an assumption is consistent with current research.  31 People that use online dating applications use these applications excessively and addictively developing dating anxieties in an online medium. Excessive Internet use for dating applications can become addictive leading to feeling of helplessness (Young, 1999), and with concerns to the privacy of their personal information, have an attitude of online apathy when faced with the alternative of not using the Internet (Hargittai, 2016).  Popular media as well as empirical studies indicate that users get addicted to online dating applications like Tinder, OK Cupid leads to offline partner anxiety and apathy towards social connectedness and offline dating impacting their real relationships in offline environment (Odac & Kalkan, 2010; Tigar, 2015).  One study revealed that high stages of tension amongst college students who are connected with each other in some formal relationship such as class team projects, or competing for high grades or coveted membership to an academic or social club would result in disconnectedness amongst themselves in otherwise social setting. Over period of time this social disconnectedness leads to the feeling of powerlessness that can lead to excessive use of the Internet generating apathy amongst students (Sashittal et al., 2012). Findings of another study revealed those high-school students who were heavy Internet users exhibited confrontational and other disruptive behaviors in the classroom (Kitishat & Al-Friehat, 2013).    1.2.7 Undesirable Effects of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) Excessive use of the Internet by young adults leads to negative offline behavior, such as increased aggression, increased anxiety, increased apathy, feelings of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness (Sashittal et al., 2012). For example, in  32 online scenarios, users may exhibit aggression causing or resulting from cyberbullying (Athanasiades, Kamariotis, Psalti, Baldry, & Sorrentino, 2015) increased anxiety can result from dating misgivings (Young, 1999),, users may harbor online apathy toward others’ information privacy (Hargittai, 2016), users may experience feelings of powerlessness due to loss social influence (Odac & Kalkan, 2010; Tigar, 2015), and users may experience social disconnectedness resulting  from a combination of all of these issues (S. E. Jones, 2014; Urbanski, 2007). The Problem of Habitual or Addictive Use of the Internet Goldberg (1995)  further described internet addiction disorder (IAD) as having  the same four measures as substance abuse : tolerance, withdrawal , craving and negative life consequences which describes the problematic use of the internet (Z. W. Lee & Cheung, 2014). It is likely that problematic Internet use (Shapira, Goldsmith, Keck, Khosla, & McElroy, 2000), leads to media addiction(LaRose, Lin, & Eastin, 2003) where Marlatt et al. ( 1988) defines addiction as “a repetitive habit pattern that increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems…often experienced subjectively as “loss of control” [that] continues despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use” (Marlatt, Baer, & Donovan, 1988, p.224). “A habit, from the standpoint of psychology, is a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience” (Andrews, 1903, p. 1). These new habits over period of time become automatic and the process is referred to as habit formation. Habit formation is always in context. Popular media reported an instance of addiction of playing online video-game “World of War craft” that resulted in unemployment, loss of social life, and neglect to personal hygiene impacting general health and well-being negatively  33 (Schmitz & Hopper, 2012). Excessive use of the Internet by young adults can produce such as increased aggression, increased anxiety, increased apathy, feelings of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness (Sashittal et al., 2012).  For example, in online scenarios, users may exhibit aggression causing or resulting from cyberbullying (Athanasiades et al., 2015) increased anxiety can result from dating misgivings (Young, 1999); users may harbor online apathy toward others’ information privacy (Hargittai, 2016), users may experience feelings of powerlessness due to loss social influence (Odac & Kalkan, 2010; Tigar, 2015), and users may experience social disconnectedness resulting  from a combination of all of these issues (S. E. Jones, 2014; Urbanski, 2007).  Likewise, in offline scenarios, users may exhibit physically aggressive behavior toward people who have bullied them online (Dehue, Bolman, & Völlink, 2008), increased anxiety toward physical relationships can result from online dating misgivings (Caplan, 2003; Schwartz & Southern, 2000), users may become more willing to gossip with acquaintances after shaming others  once they have become inured to shaming them online (Nycyk, 2015) , users may be driven to sickness or death if they are removed from social influence and from their former friends (Steptoe, Shankar, Demakakos, & Wardle, 2013).  Therefore, research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highly-undesirable offline behavior and even tragic results (“Jessica Logan,” 2015, “Ryan Halligan: The Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Megan Meier Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Story of Tyler Clementi,” 2015).  1.3 Purpose Current Study, Facebook and IS Relevance Not much research has been conducted on impetuous impression management or  34 the reasons for teenager and young adults for impetuous risqué impression projection in an online environment and more specifically in Facebook. This research therefore proposes to study the factors that influences people impetuous image projection on Facebook. The purpose of this research is to fill the identified research gap. Sidorova et al. (2008) identified how information technology (IT) systems are developed and how individuals, groups, organizations, and markets interact with IT  (Sidorova, Evangelopoulos, Valacich, & Ramakrishnan, 2008). Therefore, research on Facebook corresponds to one of the core research areas of IT systems as identified by Sidorova et al. (2008), namely how groups interact with IT (Sidorova et al., 2008).  As a group ware technology that relies on the interaction between their users, Facebook has generated tremendous value due to its vast expansion of its user-generated network  (Xu, Ryan, Prybutok, & Wen, 2012). For example a study that looked at the value of social networking in universities found that social networking is a valuable tool that the universities can harness to help their students network professionally for job placements after they graduate (Hayden, Kitchens, & MacLeod, 2010). Facebook has proved to be a learning artifact that can promote the social constructivist framework that explores the social interactions amongst the users (Ractham, Kaewkitipong, & Firpo, 2012) which constitutes another  core research area of IS (Vessey, Ramesh, & Glass, 2002).  Wilson et al. (2012) categorized previous research conducted on Facebook into various themes such as  1. Descriptive analysis of Facebook users  2. The motivation of Facebook users  3. The identity presentation on Facebook  4. The role of Facebook in social interactions   35 5. Facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues (R. Wilson, Gosling, & Graham, 2012)  6. Facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues (Koohikamali, Peak, & Prybutok, n.d.)  Relevant literature in psychology and cyber psychology has looked at issues related to anonymity, catharsis and autonomy related to unrestrained behavior in offline environment (Christopherson, 2007; Derlega & Chaikin, 1975).  Not much study has been conducted on impetuous behaviors and the effect of the impression management on Facebook. Because impetuous online leads to potentially dangerous offline suggestive behavior (Benotsch, Snipes, Martin, & Bull, 2013), which can result in tragic consequences (“Jessica Logan,” 2015, “Ryan Halligan: The Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Megan Meier Story,” 2015, “The Tragic Story of Tyler Clementi,” 2015), this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems .The above discussion informs that impetuous risqué behavior generally falls into the undesirable outcomes of online activities of the users of Facebook.  1.3.1 Impetuous and Risky Behaviors This research considers two kinds of behavior, impetuous and risky-- in both online and offline environments; however, this study focuses on impetuous behavior.  An example of impetuous behavior is the risqué behavior which is “slightly indecent and liable to shock, especially by being sexually suggestive” (“Oxford Dictionaries- Risque,” 2016). Common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting (Lohmann, 2011; Roberts, 2012).  36 Risky behavior encompasses the possibility of danger, failure, or loss (“Oxford Dictionaries- Risky,” 2016). As such both behaviors exist in online and offline environments with overlapping, but often distinct, consequences (Benotsch et al., 2013).  1.3.2 Impetuous Online/Offline versus Risky Online/Offline Behaviors Impetuous and risky online behaviors contribute to negative risqué and risky offline behaviors. This research therefore defines impetuous online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment e.g. sexting (Lohmann, 2011), flaming (Kayany, 1998). Similarly in this study impetuous offline behavior is defined as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting, and scandalous behavior that includes being sexually provocative, or being offensive, rude, hostile   in an offline environment (Wilson & Brazendale, 1973), Substance use, violent behavior, early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults (Beets et al., 2009), truancy, bullying, insubordination, disrespect, tardiness, fighting, stealing, and vandalism (Brown & Levinson, 1987).   Risky online behavior is behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the Internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. Cyber security breaches (Landwehr et al., 2012) and online espionage (Flusche, 2001; Schneier, 2014) are instances of risky online behavior  Risky offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude, e.g., social engineering (Luo, Brody, Seazzu, & Burd, 2013), competitive car  37 racing that can result in accidents (Gullone, Moore, Moss, & Boyd, 2000), high risk sexual behavior (Benotsch et al., 2013) are instances of potentially dangerous offline behaviors.  1.3.3 Impetuous Online Leading to Potentially Dangerous Offline Results Another study found that excessive amounts of “sexting” was robustly linked with “substance use and high-risk sexual behavior, including having multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex, and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections” (Benotsch et al., 2013). Online smart phone dating applications like Tinder, Grindr, Growlr, Scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers (Woo, 2015).  Impetuous behavior can be hazardous to this population for two reasons: 1) younger users invest a lot of time in the Internet, particularly in its social features (Burnay, Billieux, Blairy, & Laroi, 2015; Laconi, Tricard, & Chabrol, 2015;  Lu & Yeo, 2015) and, 2) a significant number these younger users engage in risqué online behaviors, i.e., behaviors that are considered undesirable, provocative, and/or high-risk in current society (Black, Stone, & Johnson, 2015; Peluchette & Karl, 2010;  Shah, 2010; Wahdan, Nimr, Kotb, & Wahdan, 2014). A concern of this research is that 1 and 2 can cyclically reinforce and feed each other, yielding accumulating, undesirable results for individuals and for society.  This research seeks to break this cycle and to prevent its recurrence.   1.3.4 Suggestive Risqué or Negative Online Behavior  Risqué is behavior that “slightly indecent and liable to shock, especially by being  38 sexually suggestive”(“Oxford Dictionaries,” n.d.). Common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting (Lohmann, 2011; Roberts, 2012; “What is ‘Sexting’? Nude or Risque Pics Sent by Teens Expose Them to Serious Legal and Social Consequences.,” 2009). This research therefore defines risqué online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment. It is mostly indecent (as in sexting, flirting), and scandalous behavior (as in posting provocative images) in an online environment . Risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“Definition of risqué,” n.d.). Example risqué behavior includes ‘flaming behavior’ which has been  defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability (Kayany, 1998).  1.3.4.1 Suggestive Risqué Offline Behavior   This study defines suggestive risqué offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent (as in flirting), and scandalous behavior (being sexually provocative, or being offensive, rude, hostile) in an offline environment. This type of behavior has been extensively described in popular as well as academic literatures.   Wilson and Brazendale (1973) conducted a study where they described appropriation of suggestive offline behavior by conducting an experiment that involved  39 using what they described as risqué slides of seaside postcards  based largely on sexual innuendo to administer a humor test (G. D. Wilson & Brazendale, 1973). Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported another instance of suggestive risqué offline behavior.  It has been brought to our attention by building management and Security that the stairwells are being used inappropriately.... Cigarettes, plastic cups filled with beer, and several used condoms were found in the stairwell. Yes, you read that right. Do not use the stairwells to smoke, drink, eat, or have sex. Please respect building and company policy and use common sense... (Winkler R, 2016)   Another instance of offline suggestive behavior includes demeaning derogatory sexually suggestive behavior towards teachers in classroom (Oluwole, 2015)    1.3.4.2 Dangerous Risky Online Behavior Oxford dictionary defines risky as “full of the possibility of danger, failure, or loss”(“Oxford Dictionaries- Risky,” n.d.). This research defines ‘dangerous risky online behavior’ as behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the Internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. For example risks associated with online trading has been discussed in details in academic literature (Fan & Chen, 2005; Looney, Akbulut, & Poston, 2008).  Risks associated with online gambling has also been discussed extensively in academic literature (Fishburn & Kochenberger, 1979; Krueger & Dickson, 1994).   1.3.4.3 Dangerous Risky Offline Behavior This research defines dangerous risky offline behavior as behavior that is  carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible  40 failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. Risky behavior is indecent , and scandalous behavior (meeting people for casual sexual encounters, having relationship/s outside matrimony)  in an offline  environment . It is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy. High risk sexual behaviors have been discussed extensively in academic literature (D’Arcy & Devaraj, 2012; Vakharia, 2013). Risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior. Risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare, and involving acts of substance use. Risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence, street fights, and bar fights i.e. any act that is anti-social.  1.3.4.4 Risqué Impression Behavior This research defines risqué behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment. It is mostly indecent (as in sexting, flirting), and scandalous behavior (as in posting provocative images) in an online environment. Risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“Definition of risqué,” n.d.). Example risqué behavior includes ‘flaming behavior’ which has been defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability (Kayany, 1998).  41 This research defines risky behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment.  Risky behavior is indecent, and scandalous behavior (meeting people for casual sexual encounters, having relationship/s outside matrimony,) in an offline environment. It is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy. Risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior. Risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare, vandalism, involving acts of substance use. Risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence, street fights, bar fights i.e. any act that is anti-social.  Risqué behavior is defined as indecent and scandalous behavior. It is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“Definition of risqué,” n.d.).  Popular media have acknowledged and discussed Facebook users risqué content posted on Facebook. For instance popular media, word of mouth, and social media marketing reported the ‘computer babies post’ posted by Intel which can be categorized as risqué content that went viral immediately indicating, that users post risqué content to their Facebook profile which allows them instant popularity (H. Morris, 2012). Other popular media have discussed whether risqué content should be allowed or not on Facebook (Brown, 2013; “Facebook’s ‘porn cops,’” 2010; Shapira, n.d.). However, there is not much empirical study conducted on this wide observed behavior pattern of Facebook users. Impression management thus assumes central position in this research because this work emphasizes the importance of shaping teenager personalities to become well-adapted and productive citizens in future technological society.  Impression management has been extensively researched in sociology and psychology disciplines  42 (Krämer & Winter, 2008). The framework has been applied in various practical applications as public relations (Piwinger & Ebert, 2001), forensic literature (Perri & Lichtenwald, 2010), in the area of sports and psychology (Ginis, Lindwall, & Prapavessis, 2007) and offline social behaviors like eating disorders(Herman, Roth, & Polivy, 2003). Facebook has also been researched extensively (Wilson et al., 2012)  1.3.5 Teenage Behavior and Gaming Dill and Dill (1999) showed that there are factors that influence the relationship between video games and increased violence. Video games that harness the violence-appeal are built on instant gratification. There is an instant reward or penalty for carrying out the violent act in a game. For instance, a ‘kill‘ segment will instantly gain the user with a jackpot reward or allow the user to continue to the next level. Here the gamer identifies with the character in the game in first person. These emblematic aggressions impact the psychology of the player as the player controls the character of the game and therefore the player experiences the act of aggression as seen through the eyes of the character in the game (Dill & Dill, 1999).  Understanding the impact of Video games on student’s psyche is also important from the IS discipline perspective.  1.3.5.1 How is Gaming Relevant to Information Systems? Gaming is in many ways relevant to IS and this study because this work recognizes a convergence of IS user and gaming user requirements.  Entertainment Software Association (ESA) reported that of 155 million Americans that played videogames, 26%  43 of the gamers are less than 18 years of age and an average of 6.5 hrs. Per week are spend playing with others online indicating that today’s teenagers are heavily influenced by video games (“ESA,” 2015).  According to Walsh (2000), research on absence of parental supervision reveals that  such parents almost do not check the ratings of the videogames that are purchased by the children (Carnagey & Anderson, 2004). According to ProCons, videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres (“Charts Graphs on Video Games -Youth Violence,” 2015) .Further  research indicates that violent video games desensitize children at an early age to the effects of violence (Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007). Research also indicates that It is possible for undeveloped minds of the children to get heavily influenced by these violent themes (Gunter, 1998). Research further indicates this influence induced by the content of the violence in the games can lead to acts of violence and aggression (Sherry, 2001).Thus some of the impacts when parents do not supervise their children’s offline behavior  includes increased violent and aggressive behavior, increased high-risk behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use, and accelerated onset of sexual activity (Villani, 2001). Novelty and richness of the user experience is central concept in games technology (Klimmt, Roth, Vermeulen, Vorderer, & Roth, 2016). Gaming technologies thus are assuming central focus in the IS research that involves teamwork of experts of different teams (Nandhakumar et al., 2013). Technologies that drive gaming, such as animation, visualization, interaction, and immersive technologies have been used by IS in building business applications (Arbaugh et al., 2009; Kohun & Wood, 2004), e.g., human resources use training methods like gaming, simulation, action-based learning  44 and training-on-the-job in their training and development of employees (Bergenhenegouwen, 1996).  IS is no longer focused on functional aspects of business, but now engages the ‘user experience (UX)’ to interactive gaming technology (Kulshreshth & LaViola, 2015). For example integrated 3-DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and finger-count gestures) enhances user performance and improved gaming experience (Kulshreshth & LaViola, 2015). A study that investigated factors predicting the use of smart phone based augment reality takes its theoretical inspiration from the technology acceptance model (Kim & Hyun, 2016), that links augmented reality research to core information system research. We also find that gaming applications have extended IS user community beyond business world to other professions, such as engineering (Bekebrede, Lo, & Lukosch, 2015), education (Katsaliaki & Mustafee, 2014), environmental studies (Sterman et al., 2015), policy sciences (de Caluwé, Geurts, & Kleinlugtenbelt, 2012). Businesses have been using gaming technologies to aid their business processes. Communication and information technologies such as virtual reality and augmented realities have been used in health care industry. Serious games (SR) have recently been developed which has proven effective in treatment of specific phobias (Botella et al., 2011; Wrzesien et al., 2015). Computer supported collaborative learning is a pedagogical tool that has been used for implementing educational games in the classroom (Echeverría et al., 2012). Augmented reality games through mobile technology are being used in primary and secondary education enhancing student formal or informal learning (Koutromanos, Sofos, & Avraamidou, 2015).  45 1.3.5.2 How is Gaming Relevant to this Research? System software concepts encompasses human computer interaction and thus is one of the main sub disciplines categorized under IS research (Vessey, Ramesh, & Glass, 2002, p.139,142). As research in interaction design technologies matured, researchers and practitioners started looking at ‘user experience (UX)’ as viable substitute to the already saturated discipline of human computer interaction research (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006).  Gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies (Ericsson et al., 1993; Maddux, Johnson, & Willis, 2001). Previous research on practice shows that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. User will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (Ericsson et al., 1993). Practice leads to automatic behavior and is characterized by efficiency, lack of awareness, un-intentionality, and uncontrollability (Bargh, 1994). This automatic behavior is to referred to as second nature (Konijn, 2000). Repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior. The direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature (Konijn, 2000) is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set (Bargh, 1994) and by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment. Gaming will thus impact transition of online risqué behavior to offline risky behavior tipping the balance in favor of criminal mindset thus  46 upsetting the equilibrium and balance that modern society enjoys. Gaming represents an avenue to understand impression management in an IS context. Research has shown that innovative development of digital technologies especially gaming technologies are centralized over human carnal pleasures (Lahti, 2003). Previous studies conducted on success of sportsmen shows that amount of sports practice by the sports practitioner is positively correlated with the success achieved (Gimeno & García-Mas, 2010). This correlates achievements of goals to the repetitive practice.  Gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies. The online environment that involves a dangerous or criminal fantasy can thus have problematic implications (Anderson & Bushman, 2001; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Funk, Baldacci, Pasold, & Baumgardner, 2004; Prensky, 2006; Przybylski, Ryan, & Rigby, 2009). Interactive video games that combine physical exercise with gameplay and are called exergames. Active technologies or exergames are primitive augmented reality applications and were invented that allowed the gamers to use a wireless remote controller, a wireless device that the gamer will hold the device and the technology induces the dynamic physical somatic movements of the hand of the gamer on to the video screen (Millington, 2009). User interface embodiment refers to the degree to which the user’s body interacts with the game. A study has revealed that user interface embodiment has enhanced the user’s experience, which basically reflects the user’s involvement in the game. Study also revealed that enjoyment experienced by the users increases the intentions of the user to further engage in playing those games (Kim, Prestopnik, & Biocca, 2014). Previous research on practice shows that the act of  47 repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. Users will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (Ericsson et al., 1993). Drills are the software that are intended to allow the user to practice a skill set (Maddux, Johnson, & Willis, 2001).  “A habit, from the standpoint of psychology, is a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience” (Andrews, 1903, p. 1). It is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior (Neal et al., 2006). These new habits over period of time become automatic and the process is referred to as habit formation. Habit formation is always in context.  As behaviors are repeated in a context the link between the context and the behavior strengthens and over period of time, when an event occurs that triggers the context, the behavior linked with the context is automatically performed. This forms the automaticity of the behavior in the context (Wood & Neal, 2007). Research has shown that innovative development of digital technologies especially gaming technologies are centralized over human carnal pleasures (Lahti, 2003). Previous studies conducted on success of sportsmen shows that amount of sports practice by the sports practitioner is positively correlated with the success achieved (Gimeno & García-Mas, 2010). This correlates achievements of goals to the repetitive practice.  Gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies.  Previous research on practice shows that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. User will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (Ericsson et al.,  48 1993). Repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior The direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature which is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment.  The online environment that involves a dangerous or criminal fantasy can thus have problematic implications (Anderson & Bushman, 2001; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Funk et al., 2004; Prensky, 2006; Przybylski et al., 2009).  1.3.5.3 How is Gaming Relevant to Impression Management? Gaming influences the goal relevance of the user’s impression motivation, which is a dimension of impression motivation (Ericsson et al., 1993; Gimeno & García-Mas, 2010; Leary & Kowalski, 1990; Pintrich, 2000; Schlenker, Forsyth, Leary, & Miller, 1980). There are two variables in impression management, impression motivation (the predictor), and impression construction (the dependent variable). Expectancy-value approach to ‘self-presentation’ suggests that people are motivated to project images that can get them the maximum returns and allows people to manipulate trade offs between costs and rewards as they deal with their impression management on other people (Schlenker et al., 1980).  Leary and Kowalski (1990) described goal relevance of impressions as an antecedent to impression motivation. These researchers linked achievement of relevant goals that includes social and material outcomes as factors that influences impression motivation (Leary & Kowalski, 1990).   49 1.3.6 Teenage Behavior and Facebook 1.3.6.1 How is Facebook Relevant to Information Systems? Facebook in its own right has proved to be a learning artifact that can promote the social constructivist framework that explores the social interactions amongst the users (Ractham et al., 2012) which constitutes one of the core research area of IS (Vessey et al., 2002). In this study we have concentrated on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by studying how the student population adopts IT and what factors influence the online risqué behavior of students on social networking sites, and in this way, our paper represents a mainstream area of Information Science (IS) research and contributes to the development of the discipline.   1.3.6.2 Why Facebook is Relevant to this Research To address the issues related to uncertainty associated with Facebook research, Wilson et al. (2012) studied and identified 412 peer reviewed research articles on Facebook literature.  This work categorizes this previous research into six distinct themes.  1) The descriptive analysis of Facebook users, which is captured by responses answering who are Facebook users and how do they use Facebook (Judd & Kennedy, 2010; Kirman, Lawson, & Linehan, 2009; Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2008; M. Lee, Weng, Lin, & Ma, 2011; McCorkindale, 2010; Nguyen & Tran, 2011; Ryan & Xenos, 2011) 2) The motivation of Facebook users, which is captured by responses answering why people use Facebook (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010; Baek, Holton, Harp, & Yaschur, 2011; Cheung, Chiu, & Lee, 2011; Ross, Orr, Sisic,  50 & Arseneault, 2009; J. Underwood, Kerlin, & Farrington-Flint, 2011; Wang, Moon, Kwon, & Evans, 2010) 3) The identity presentation on Facebook, which is captured by responses answering how people present themselves on Facebook (Hum, Chamberlin, & Hambright, 2011; J. D. M. J. Underwood, Kerlin, & Farrington-Flint, 2011; Wang et al., 2010; Zhao, Grasmuck, & Martin, 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) 4) The role of Facebook in social interactions, which is captured by responses answering how Facebook impacts relationships among groups and individuals (Bohnert & Ross, 2010; Darvell, Walsh, & White, 2011; Karl, Peluchette, & Schlaegel, 2010a; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010; Mutawa, Awadhi, & Baggili, 2011) 5) Facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues, which is captured by responses answering why people disclose personal information on Facebook despite potential risks (Fogel & Nehmad, 2009; Nosko, Wood, & Molema, 2010; N. Park, Jin, & Jin, 2011; Stutzman, Capra, & Thompson, 2011; Tang, Wang, Xiong, Yang, & Hu, 2011) 6) Facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues, which is captured by responses answering why people disclose other peoples’ information on Facebook despite potential risks (Koohikamali, Peak, & Prybutok, n.d.). Relevant literature in psychology and cyber psychology has looked at issues related to anonymity, catharsis and autonomy related to unrestrained behavior in offline environment (Christopherson, 2007; Derlega & Chaikin, 1975). Psychology has also addressed impression management at length in an offline environment (Baumeister,  51 Bratslavsky, & Muraven, 1998; Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Goffman, 1978; Leary, 1995; Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Leary & Kowalski, 1990; Leary, Tchividijian, & Kraxberger, 1994; Morris & Feldman, 1996; Tang et al., 2011; Valenzuela, Park, & Kee, 2009a). Facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues’ is a theme which is captured by responses answering why people disclose personal information on Facebook despite potential risks (Fogel & Nehmad, 2009; Nosko et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011; Stutzman et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2011).  ‘Facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues’ is another theme which is captured by responses answering why people disclose other peoples’ information on Facebook despite potential risks (Koohikamali, Peak, & Prybutok, n.d.).  1.3.6.3 Why Facebook is Relevant to Impression Management Previous research in psychology describes three goals that motivates people to manage their impressions when they perceive that  those impressions are relevant to fulfilment of those goals (Leary, 1995; Leary & Kowalski, 1990). People engage in self presentation as a means of creating their identities (Baumeister, 1982; Gollwitzer, 1986).  They are also  motivated to maintain and enhance their self-esteem (Jones, 1973; Morris Rosenberg, Schooler, Schoenbach, & Rosenberg, 1995) and they use impression management to acquire their desired  social and material wants (Schlenker, 1980; Tedeschi, 2013). As already discussed in the above section, Facebook is used by people for acquiring social desired outcomes as described in Theme 4; and  for identity presentation as described in Theme 3. Facebook has also been studied extensively in the context of self esteem (Błachnio, Przepiorka, & Pantic, 2016; Greitemeyer, 2016;  52 Skues, Williams, & Wise, 2012; Subramanian, Wise, Davis, Bhandari, & Morris, 2014; Tazghini & Siedlecki, 2013)  1.3.6.4 Relevance of Impression Management to IS Vessey et al. (2002) lists the topics that are studies under IS research (Vessey et al., 2002). Some of those topics include systems/software management concepts (project management, risk management, personnel issues); problems domain specific concepts (information systems including group support systems); organizational concepts (strategies, cultural implications); societal concepts (cultural implications, ethical implications) (Vessey et al., 2002). These topics can be linked to the topics studied under impression management (IM). Leary and Kowalski (1990) describe IM to have consisted of topics such as goal relevance of impressions, value of desired goals, discrepancy between desired and current image, impression construction, construct of self,  desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, targets value and current or potential image. It is concluded that Impression management covers a wide spectrum of core research areas in information systems. Impression management can thus be seen to have a direct relevance to IS research.   1.3.7 Groupware Technology When technologies are designed in such a way that they serve the purpose of facilitating human interactions with the system rather than systems being used to solve some problems, they are called groupware systems. “Groupware is defined as computer based systems that supports groups of people engaged in a common task or goals and  53 that provide an interface to a shared environment” (Ellis, Gibbs, & Rein, 1991).  Christopherson (2007) studied influences of anonymity in computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Sia et.al. (2002) study that looked at group polarization using groupware conferencing apparatus that utilized text based communications indicates that Facebook is groupware technology.  1.4 Problem Statement The usage of SNS and the computer mediated communication media has been appropriated beyond its intended use. This study concentrates on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by exploring how the student population adopts IT and what factors influence the online behavior of students on social networking sites, and in this way, our paper represents a mainstream area of Information Science (IS) research and contributes to the development of the discipline. This study attempts to study the impression motivation which is the awareness that Facebook is being used for uses other than the intended uses on the Image construction which is the behavior exhibited through their online profile images. The current research proposes to investigate balancing of the tradeoff between perceived privacy concerns and an active social media presence. The proposed generalized research question of this dissertation is “Do active social media presence and various privacy concerns have any influence on student’s online behaviors on social media?” This research will investigate this question in three different studies as following: Essay 1 investigates impression management theory as applied to social networking. The growth of social networking sites in the last few years has changed the  54 pattern of its utility thereby providing yet another new social phenomenon.  Essay 1 focus on the business implications by investigating the intention of recruiting managers to use social networking sites like Facebook and Myspace to conduct checks on prospective job candidates. Also, school authorities and law enforcement have occasionally used Facebook evidence for taking actions because they have been able to confirm or trace of criminal activities. Using the framework of impression management theory, this study examines how online behavior of students is related to visibility awareness, social networking site information trust, and awareness of various features of technology.  Essay 1 thus examines if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as visibility awareness and privacy concerns which is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave responsibly which is operationalized as Responsible image on social media.  In Essay 2, I extend Essay 1 and fill in the research gap to investigate the negative impression management of students on Facebook. I focus on the risks associated with negative or risqué online behavior of students that can get mimicked to risky offline behaviors often leading to tragic results. Using the framework of impression management theory, I examine how negative online behavior of students is related to students portraying different personalities by selectively disclosing their personas aided by awareness of various privacy features of technology.  Essay 2 thus explores if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as selective disclosure, and desired differential personas and privacy concerns that is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave negatively which is operationalized as negative or risqué image on social media.  55 In Essay 3, I extend the conceptual framework of Essay 1 and look at trust and privacy of social networking while investigating factors influencing student behavior on Facebook in the context of impression management. With this study, I aim to extend the previous studies by using the framework of trust in digital information to investigate privacy and security concerns related to the use of social networking. This essay is still a work in progress and I am in the process of analyzing data. Essay 3 researches if factors such as dimensions of active social media presence such as impression motivation and information trustworthiness and privacy concerns operationalized as technology awareness influences students to have distinct impression management operationalized as Image construction on social media.  My investigation shows that the impression management framework serves as the most important base model for predictors of social networking behaviors to increase the awareness of information and cyber security in order to promote the best security practices. Each essay has been built by reviewing the existing literature in social networking, cyber security and information systems theories to increase the awareness of privacy and security concerns related with problematic use of the Internet. The research and the frameworks posited, allow us to identify relevant concerns and directions for further research. My work posits and supports new theory development and shows the overarching importance of researching privacy and security in social network analysis as a major organizational construct.  1.5 Research Design The rest of this study is organized as below. The next section describes  56 generalized literature review that discusses the periphery of the problem area. The three research essays follow this. Each research essay is organized with its own introduction, literature review, statement of hypotheses, research model, methodology, proposed instruments, data analysis, discussion and implications and limitations.  ","1 chapter 1 introduction and problem statement 1.1 subject area 1.1.1 importance of social media research web-based social networking is in a general sense changing the way we interact, team up, appropriate, and create. they signify the most effective change driven results of information technology on businesses impacted by professional and personal lives of the stakeholders (aral, dellarocas, & godes, 2013). social networking is a ubiquitous phenomenon. it has percolated not only the personal lives of its users but it has also impacted the professional domains thereby making its way in to the main stream business discipline. enforced public visibility is the direct consequences of the omni-evolving appropriation of social media. an example of user being forced to use social media can be an online job portal like linkedin or facebook that helps people to stay connected with their friends and families. recent studies indicate that people have started appropriating social media in aiding their businesses (kaplan & haenlein, 2010b; kärkkäinen, jussila, & väisänen, 2010; treem & leonardi, 2013). dutta (2010) argues that every businessperson must now have a personal social media strategy. today’s leaders must embrace social media for three reasons. first they provide a low-cost platform on which to build your personal brand, communicating who you are both within and outside your company. second they allow you to engage rapidly and simultaneously with peers, employees, customers, and the broader public, especially younger generations in the same transparent and direct way they expect from everyone in their lives. third they give you an opportunity to learn from instant information and unvarnished feedback. (dutta, 2010, p. 2) research in social media includes investigating activities of its users and the level of those investigations. aral et al. (2013) classifies areas of activities in to four broad 2 categories namely: “design and features, strategy and tactics, management & organization, and measurement & value at three levels namely: consumers and society, platforms and intermediaries, and firms and industries” (aral et al., 2013, p. 4). i am addressing the problem domain that broadly considers intersection of design & features of social media analyzed at the level of and platforms and intermediaries. research associated with design and features includes investigating the appropriation of features of social networking by different stakeholders such as individuals in social context, and individuals in context of business users. this category depicts how patrons, companies, and governments use explicit social media features and how these technologies are made available to the users. at the same time design research also considers how constrains can be enforced to prevent misappropriation of the same features. thus design looks in to standardizing and regulating the various facets of social media development and implementation. individuals, businesses, or governments are the users of social media, which constitutes platforms and intermediaries that continuously, innovate and grow using the platform of social media such as twitter, facebook etc. aral et al. (2013) have listed some of the research agendas, which lie in the intersection of my research domain of interest. they are: • how can users optimize their use of social media? • which objectives do users pursue in using social media? • how can users create relationships, curate information, broaden their reach, and maximize their influence? • what are the benefits and risks associated with use of social media? • what is the nonmonetary value that social media create (e.g., equality, health, violence, civic engagement)? 3 • how do specific features and designs help platforms attract users, create engagement, enable and constrain user behavior, and increase revenue? • how can platforms maximize their influence and revenue? • should platforms be open or closed, standardized or ad hoc? (aral et al., 2013) process of social interactions is complex and governed by societal norms. social media features are designed and developed in such a way that they enforce constraints on the user behavior to conform to the societal norms. social media thus exhibit candid impact on the societal framework (aral et al., 2013). social media is the futuristic phenomenon intricately associated with human behavior and in the emerging era of the internet of things, its understanding has become critical for new directions in development of technologies. one of the emerging trends of the appropriation of social media includes the talent acquisition process where companies have started appropriating social networks to track talent to match to the open positions (aral et al., 2013). linkedin is one such example, where a service that began as a job portal emerged in to a social media where the jobseekers do not have to pay for registration and create a profile. garg and telang (2011) reported that “features in linkedin, such as connections, which can either be further, classified as weak or strong serves different purposes. weak ties help the individual to come across a job lead while the strong ties and first connection helps an individual to get job interview as well as job offer” (garg & telang, 2011). the site slowly developed to include features that encouraged the job seekers to update much more information than just their resume. the features of endorsing skills which essentially is a part of social network analysis is appropriated by the employers to gather much more information about the candidate to be able to perform a close fit of the talent to the open positions. premium services are created both for the job seekers and the employers. 4 hence it is thus seen that many job portals have emerged in to becoming social networking sites, the concept being social networking encourages users to upload much more social information in context of the talent acquisition. this makes more information available to both the parties the job seekers and the employers. on one hand jobseekers gain more information such as average salaries that a position can command, best working conditions, perks and benefits and so on. on the other hand the employers can gather much more information about the candidate apart, which gives them the ability to match the right candidate to the right job. this kind of appropriation has transformed the job portals into something much more giving the service providers competitive edge (w. kim, jeong, & lee, 2010; schwartz, 2013). evolution of social media in this direction gives rise to the considerations that users can use to strategically position themselves on the social media in order to realize their goals pertaining to their career choices. research in social media and social networking is still in its embryonic stage and is emerging. the above research has introduced my specific area of research interest in the information related phenomenon that is observed in the emergence of social media. the above section also leads us to finding out why social networking is an area of interest under the discipline of information sciences. 1.1.2 social networking in context of impression management social networking sites have been a focus of empirical research and have been studied from the perspective of impression management in various interdisciplinary studies such as psychology, sociology, computer-mediated communications etc. 5 rosenberg and egbert (2011) studied the utility of personality traits and secondary goals as predictors of self-presentation tactics employed by facebook users. secondary goals are recurring motivations in an individual’s life and include identity goals, interaction goals, personal resource goals, and arousal management goals (dillard, segrin, & harden, 1989). rosenberg and egbert reported that individual personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals and that secondary goals predicted the use of various self-presentation tactics used on facebook. results indicated that these personality traits and secondary goals are both theoretically and empirically sound components for the conceptualization of online impression management (rosenberg & egbert, 2011). this study prompts further research in self presentation on facebook considering the effect of audience segmentation and how individuals deal with problems of multiple audiences having access to their profile and being witnesses to their activity on facebook, such as friends versus family members (lampe, ellison, & steinfield, 2006; lampe, ellison, & steinfield, 2007; stutzman, 2006). for instance, a child may experience uncertainty when parent would want to be added to the child’s facebook page. the child may not want the parent to view his/or her facebook page. i have engaged this theme in my research essay where i investigated factors affecting online behavior of people living with hiv and aids on facebook where one of the construct i have looked at is the selective disclosure in context of stigma faced by people living with hiv. allbright (2002) conducted a study to investigate relationship formation over computer mediated communication channels. contrary to notion where physical proximity and cues such as eye contact, body language, etc. have been seen as critical to the 6 formation of attraction, this study investigates how relationships are formed online without physical proximity and cues. a popular belief about online profiles is that people are more likely to construct false profiles with respect to their true age, class, and even gender. using goffman's theory of impression management and literature on deception in communication, this study compared the first impression people formed online with the ""second impression"" formed offline, and the reason for any disparity in the two impressions. albright reported that most people were honest with each other online, and the majority of participants reported being as or more attracted to their online lovers with increased information via phone calls, photos exchanged and face to face meetings. most mis-impressions in these relationships were the result of respondents ""filling in the blanks"" incorrectly, or idealization, rather than being victims of overt deception. albright gives direction for future research in three areas. she points out that not much research has been conducted in the areas of projection and idealization. secondly she urges the researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate if these relationships are more viable long term than those formed in face-to-face contexts. and lastly, albright recommends that further investigations are needed to assess why some relationships never move out of the online environment to a face-to-face meeting (albright, 2002). using albrights themes one area that i have looked in to is the invisibility issue face by communities of people living with hiv and aids in context of the stigma associated with the disease. i have looked at solution space for people having concerns about disclosing their identities to use sns as a platform to be able to meet other people living with hiv with the aim of forming long-term relationships in my research study titled benefits and 7 risks associated with using secret facebook support group for people living with hiv and aids. snss constitute an important research context for scholars investigating processes of impression management, self-presentation, and friendship performance. in one of the earliest academic articles on snss, boyd (2004) examined friendster as a locus of publicly articulated social networks that allowed users to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others (donath & boyd, 2004). donath and boyd (2004) extended this to suggest that ‘‘public displays of connection’’ serve as important identity signals that help people navigate the networked social world, in that an extended network may serve to validate identity information presented in profiles (donath & boyd, 2004). in listing user motivations for friending, boyd (2006) points out that friends on snss are “not the same as ‘friends’ in the everyday sense; instead, friends provide context by offering users an imagined audience to guide behavioral norms.” 1.1.3 social networking in context of cyber security within social media research, another problem domain is the cyber security concerns. social media use has been appropriated in industry espionage (spying and social media: dos and don’ts for guerrilla marketing in the internet age.2015; albrecht, 2011; algarni, xu, & chan, 2015; alge, ; braun & esswein, 2013; braun & esswein, 2016; gaff, 2014; hall, 2010; hill, 2011a; hill, 2011b; judge, 2013; molok, ahmad, & chang, 2011; nuha & molok, 2011; salminen & degbey, 2015; villarreal, 2012). studies have been conducted that investigates identity theft in context of social networking sites. “participants in social network sites create self-descriptive profiles that include their links 8 to other members, creating a visible network of connections — the ostensible purpose of these sites is to use this network to make friends, dates, and business connections” (donath & boyd, 2004, p.71). consider a case of social climber who can build an impressive résumé by name-dropping of famous people as his friends benefiting from the fact that the listener is unable to verify the authenticity. these connections displayed publicly in social networking sites indicate signals that represent attributes or qualities. for e g. a person who uploads images that displays music studios in back ground and has other famous musicians in the picture along with him signals that probably he belongs to the music industry. because “ public display of connection implies verification of identity and can be viewed as a signal of the reliability of one’s identity claims (donath & boyd, 2004, p. 73), public display of connections can also help someone else establish that they are you, too” (donath & boyd, 2004, p. 76). participants in social networks make their personal social world information publicly available, which can be appropriated in social engineering attacks by the perpetrators or used by the perpetrators for identity theft. the rapid growth of social networking sites (sns) like facebook or linkedin has a dramatic effect on identity theft for two main reasons. aïmeur and schőnfeld, (2011) studied identity theft in the context of the facebook. their work reported that since facebook has the largest database that contains qualitative as well as quantitative data on its users’ personal information, perpetrators have found it to be lucrative for conducting identity theft attacks. in 2010, the database of facebook was compromised, and it was discovered that 1.5 million accounts along with their associated data was available on sale at all time low price of 45 usd per 1000 contacts (""idefense: 1.5 million facebook accounts for sale,"" 2010). also, once the user uploads the information in facebook, the 9 user loses all control over that information there has been ambiguity in the transparency relate to the protection of the privacy of its users and the ownership of the uploaded content on the facebook. another security concern faced my most social networking sites is its registration mechanism. snss do not validate the users’ identity with any authentication mechanism, e.g., using driving license or ssn to validate if the user is whom the user says is. since anybody can create a profile by any name, upload any content to that profile; this can lead to direct identity theft. “anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages” (aïmeur & schőnfeld, 2011, p. 26). hackers can hack in to legitimate facebook accounts and collect personal information not only about the user but also collect information about the user's friends and their friends. a second major threat of sns concerns the registration process. actually, sns do not check the identity of the users and anyone can assume any name without control. these procedures could lead directly to identity theft with dire consequences for the reputation of the real persons. anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages. the theft of legitimate accounts is also easy in sns and the hackers use the information contained in the profile itself to take possession of it. a last point about sns is to know in which measure we can trust these systems for the protection of data. most of these sites are actually free of charge for the users and their only source of income is derived from targeted advertising. the resale or the right of access to personal data for advertisers constitutes an enormous information security breach. 10 1.1.4 social networking in context of information science borko (1968) defines information science (is) as “that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces that governs the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability.” borko further says that information science is related to mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, library science, management, and other similar fields and consists of a pure science component which inquires in to the subject without regards to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products (1968). boyd and ellison defines social network sites (sns) as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system (2007). from the above two definitions we see that sns are web based services, a component included in the borko’s definition allowing exchange of information as individuals construct profiles and articulate list of other users with whom they establish connections to share their profiles, messages, pictures, in short information. wilson (2000) in his work “human information behavior” provides the definition of information seeking behavior. information seeking behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal. in the course of seeking, the individual may interact with manual information systems (such as a newspaper or a library), or with computer-based systems (such as the world wide web). (wilson, 2000, p. 49) 11 ashgar (2015) recognized the popularity of facebook as a source of information and his work resulted in the development of 23-item scale of information seeking in facebook (isfs) that looked at information seeking behavior and other motives such as socialization, entertainment, self-seeking, diversion in facebook usage. the study involved administering the scale to 150 facebook users and analysis of the data showed strong reliability of cronbach’s alpha as 0.89. the study used several self-report measures such as general social media usage, online friendships, facebook friendships, and social media use integration to obtain a strong construct validity. validity and reliability support suggests that isfs (information seeking in facebook scale) can be used to measure information seeking behavior on social networking sites like facebook (asghar, 2015). this research has identified a research gap. it was shown by junco (2012) that information seeking in facebook is associated with student engagement or performance indicating that collecting and sharing information through facebook was a positive predictor of academic performance (gpa) (junco, 2012). while socialization and time spent on facebook were negative predictors of gpa, time spent on facebook was only weakly related to the time spent preparing for class (asghar, 2015). this implies that there must be another process that must be in play that can relate the relationship between facebook use and gpa. 1.1.5 information science in context of impression management impression management (im), a term originated by erving goffman (1959), describes a central aspect of role theory: how individual actors create, maintain, defend, and often enhance their social identities through assumptions, settings, props, and scripts 12 in a play metaphor (dillard et al., 2000, goffman 1959, and schlenker 1980). im explains the motivations behind complex human interactions and performances. in the age of information, use and control of information plays a pivotal role in our day to day routine. impression management controls and regulates the information that people manipulate in order to influence the impressions they form on other people. it’s an activity driven by goals. shlenker (1980) says that people try to manage impressions of a “person (e.g., self, friends, enemies), object (e.g., a business organization, a gift, a consumer product), event (e.g., a transgression, a task performance), or idea (e.g., pro-life versus pro-choice policies, capitalism versus socialism) through a processes of impression management” (schlenker, 1980). when people try to manage impressions on others about themselves, the process is termed as self-presentation. the origins of impression management can be traced back to erving goffman (1959) where he uses the metaphor of “world stage” to describe role theory, where every person is an actor and will act their part through social complex interactions and social identities. im is the goal-directed attempt to influence others’ perceptions about a person, a group, and/or an organization regarding an object or event by providing self-assessed beneficial information in social interactions. the goal for the aforementioned attempt is to gain an advantageous first impression. the motive for this goal is based on the assumption that the target audience’s impressions about the individuals, groups, or organizations become reality of the target audience (goffman, 1959; leary & kowalski, 1990). on the im “stage,” the target audience can be either real or imaginary. the impression exists in the subliminal level through socialization and generally does not manifest until the “actor” either succeeds or fails to resonate with the target “audience” and, in turn, the 13 targeted “audience” transforms the performance of the “actor” into the reality of the target “audience.” figure 1.1.goffman’s impression management model. one of the prime concepts in impression management is role constraints. social roles carry expectations regarding how individuals who occupy those roles are to behave (sarbin & allen, 1968). the failure to convey impressions consistent with one's role not only diminishes one's effectiveness in that role, but also in many cases can lead the individual to lose the right to enact that role (goffman, 1959). conveying impressions is effectively the communication process requiring that the process needs both sending and receiving of information linking role constraints to the study under information science. goffman (1959) provided an insightful analysis of the “role governed nature of self-presentation”. his observations included the analysis of how people behave when they are not in front of their target audience. goffman notes that in ‘back stage’ i.e., when the target audience is absent, the actor (individuals) will come out of their role- governed acting. the actor will relax. behaviors will be more ‘regressed’ involving informal dialects or lingo using openly sexual remarks and a kidding attitude (1959, p. 112). goffman went on to raise the interesting question of whether ""a backstage gives individuals an opportunity to regress or whether regression, inappropriate occasions that are not socially 14 accepted brings out the ‘regressed’ or back stage behavior (1959, p. 128). studying user behavior is a domain under the specialty of user theory, which is one of the main sub disciplines in information science (white & mccain, 1998, p. 337). impression management finally refers to current or potential social image. finally, the impressions people try to create are affected both by how they think they are currently regarded by others and by how they think others may perceive them in the future (on the basis of future revelations about them, for example). public failures and embarrassing events compel people to engage in impressionable strategies designed to counter or repair the damaged image (goffman, 1955). information science also includes analytical study of learned literatures and their social contexts (white & mccain, 1998, p. 337). wilson (2000) describes the intedisciplinarity of information science discipline. information science is not the only discipline to be concerned with the user and use of information. mention has been made earlier of the role of the user requirements phase in the design of computer-based systems, but other disciplines also have an interest from different perspectives. for example, psychological studies of personality have dealt with information processing and cognition. (wilson, 2000, p. 52) the above research informs the audience on the connectedness between information science and impression management. 1.1.6 information science and cyber security 1.1.6.1 fuzzy logic (information science) and cyber security uncertainty is one of the basic facets of human cognition. the concept of a generalized constraint, and its fundamental premise is that information may be viewed as a generalized constraint. the generalized theory of uncertainty proposed by zadeh (2005) increases our understanding of the foundations of information and uncertainty 15 .“uncertainty is linked to information through the concept of granular structure––a concept which plays a key role in human interaction with the real world” (higashi & klir, 1982; zadeh, 1979). granulation is inescapable in human cognition. the concept of defining linguistic variables where possible values for the variable ‘age’ could be young, middle-aged, and old entwines with the concept of granularity (zedeh, 1973). connection between granulation of attribute and the use of linguistic variable can be explained by the fact that cognitive capabilities of human sensory organs and brain have limited ability to store information. “for example, looking at monika, i see that she is young but cannot pinpoint her age as a single number (zadeh, 2005, p .3). the concept of a linguistic variable plays a pivotal role in almost all applications of fuzzy logic (dubois, prade, & yager, 1997; yager & filev, 1994). the above research informs the connection between information science and fuzzy networks. research has progressed on how data is processed at the remote terminal unit level using fuzzy logic and fuzzy-genetic algorithms (kumar, chandna, & thomas, 2003). preprocessed data integral to the development of automation substations (p. 1582), revolutionizing automation scenario in power systems (thomas, kumar, & chandna, 2004) is foundational to supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) networks. patel, bhatt, and graham (2009) report that utility and infrastructure companies use scada networks for managing public transportation in a given metropolitan area, typically comprising buses, subways, and elevated trains as well as in transportation of raw materials for manufacturing of electricity, oil, gas and various other commodities (patel, bhatt, & graham, 2009). scada networks allow many devices to be operated remotely such as track switches, traffic signals, electric circuit breakers, valves, relays, sensors, and water and gas pumps. many of these networks that were 16 already implemented in infrastructures were developed with little or no consideration towards security and they thus have become susceptible to being easy targets of attacks by terrorist groups. kumar et al. further reports that scada network are extremely popular in the field of industrial production due to its natural propinquity for its use of internet and wireless technologies allowing automatic monitoring of remote facilities. “modern scada networks, integrated with corporate networks and the internet, have become far more vulnerable to unauthorized cyber-attacks” (patel et al., 2009, p. 131). 1.1.6.2 security as a function of information asymmetries in a nobel prize winning work, economist george akerlof in 1984 discuss markets with asymmetric information. “akerlof showed informational asymmetries could produce adverse selection in market. asymmetric information is a common feature of market interactions” (as cited in lofgren, persson, & weibull, 2002, p. 196). with respect to quality of the products, seller often is better informed than the buyer. in case of security products, security product vendor’s projects often try to market the capabilities of their products. software security returns on investment are often intangible. “roi is the present value of accumulated net benefits over a certain time period, divided by the initial costs of investments” (jerman-blažič, 2008, p. 418). in case of information security, cost can easily be computed, as it is the cost of the information security products and the cost of operations. benefits of implementing security measures are intangible. “it is very difficult to define, assess or measure the benefits. firewalls, ids, antivirus software and other security solutions do not generate revenue that can be measured” (jerman-blažič, 2008, p. 418). prior research indicates, “the benefits resulting from information security 17 investment are measured as cost savings that result from preventing information security breaches (gordon & loeb, 2006). the vendors know that the buyers will not be able to assess the benefits and often get away with quoting high prices for the security products. since buyers are not able to trust the vendor’s claims, buyers are disinclined in high investments in security measures. vendors are thus disinclined to invest in development of high quality security products (anderson & moore, 2006). the seller of a good often knows more about its quality than the prospective buyer. the job applicant typically knows more about his ability than his potential employer (lofgren, persson, & weibull, 2002). because buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for quality they cannot measure, buyers often determines the prices they are willing to pay. at those prices, sellers are only able to offer low quality products. the software market suffers from the same information asymmetry. when personal information will be used in privacy decision-making and how it would be used is knowledge only amongst subset of the decision makers leads to privacy violations caused by asymmetric information. incomplete information affects privacy decisions (acquisti & grossklags, 2005, p. 27). privacy breaches can occur when people benefits from transactions using a third person’s personal information without that person being a part of that transaction (varian, 1997). asymmetrical information also occurs since benefits occurring from taking privacy protecting measures cannot be measured (‘deterministic’) and uncertain, since benefits may be stochastic and rely on other new arbitrary distributions (acquisti & grossklags, 2005, p 27). acquisti further say that people have tendency to take decisions that favor immediate gratifications even if they know that the decision may be hurt them in the long run. an example of this would be a student (on 18 limited income) deciding to install a free antivirus software with limited capabilities. benefits associated with protection against privacy intrusion are often recognized only after the privacy violations have taken place. if the damage involves financial loss which can be quantified, it becomes easy to see the benefits that could have prevented the damage by implementing protection measures. but often these benefits are more complex, multifaceted and are context specific. this research informs the audience the connection between security as a function of information that makes it an area of investigation under the discipline of information sciences. 1.2 introduction to the problem statement 1.2.1 positive online leads to positive offline behavior research and practice indicate that computer users, including internet users, generally mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior (yee, bailenson, & ducheneaut, 2009). in fact, this robust online-offline relationship is a fundamental tenet of computer training, which anticipates that online training of positive concepts and activities should reinforce positive offline beliefs and performance (eastmond, 1995a; matthews, 1999; moore & kearsley, 2011; robst, 2007; vrasidas, 2000). surprisingly, relatively little research has focused on the relationship between negative online and negative offline behaviors. 1.2.2 negative online leads to negative offline behavior training reinforces many behaviors (konijn, 2000), but it is the training context that determines whether the reinforcement effects are positive or negative. negative 19 behaviors are those that can have an adverse effect on the well-being and performance of those who were the target (burnes & pope, 2007). this research focuses on the dark side of the training relationship, suggesting that online training of negative concepts and activities should likewise reinforce negative offline beliefs and performance. negative behaviors are those that border on incivility, aggression, violence (pearson, andersson, & wegner, 2001). impetuous behavior is defined as behavior with negative connotation, which is characterized with people acting on a sudden idea without considering the results of their actions (“urban dictionary: impetuous,” 2016). it also means reckless or irresponsible behavior (meltzer, 2005). this study also considers impetuous behaviors to include risqué behaviors that are sexually-suggestive behaviors which can border on being uncivil (sexual harassment), rude, insensitive (sexual advances), and disrespectful (p. brown & levinson, 1987). table 1.1 type of behaviors behaviors online offline impetuous risqué: (sexually suggestive) sexting, flaming (sending rude messages, cussing), posting suggestive images ftf: flirting risky (dangerous) on-line trading, online-espionage, cyber-attacks hackers. cyber thefts. high-risk sexual behavior (multiple partners), ftf street fights, competitive car racing. national security attacks, social engineering. 20 1.2.3 continuous or almost obsessive compulsive use of the internet piu (problematic internet use ) may lead to online automatic behavior (goldberg, 1995; neal, wood, & quinn, 2006), which can translate in to second nature (konijn, 2000),which the users may mimic in the offline environment (mckenna & green, 2002). it is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior (neal et al., 2006). therefore, research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highly-undesirable offline behavior and even tragic results (“jessica logan,” 2015, “ryan halligan: the story,” 2015, “the tragic megan meier story,” 2015, “the tragic story of tyler clementi,” 2015). thus this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems 1.2.4 the problem of inadequate parental internet supervision and control inadequate parental supervision and control of children’s online behavior (morrongiello, kane, & zdzieborski, 2011; morrongiello, read, et al., 2011) contributes to negative offline behavior. previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children, including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children; therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children (morrongiello, kane, et al., 2011). this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior (newcomb & loeb, 1999). substance use, violent behavior, early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults are some of the negative behaviors (beets et al., 2009). bullying others at workplace (burnes & pope, 2007) is extension of negative aggressive behaviors. other negative behaviors include truancy, bullying, 21 insubordination, disrespect, tardiness, fighting, stealing, and vandalism (p. brown & levinson, 1987). another factor that influences the onset of problematic online behavior in young internet users is largely attributable to inadequate parental supervision and control over their offspring (morrongiello, kane, & zdzieborski, 2011; morrongiello, read, et al., 2011). previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children, including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children; therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children (morrongiello, kane, et al., 2011). this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior (newcomb & loeb, 1999). games and simulation overlap (aircraft simulators, math games, spelling games) are designed to help students so that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set effects in enhancing, grasping, learning a talent set or a conduct (ericsson, krampe, & tesch-römer, 1993). previous research indicates that games provide effective motivational learning environments (trevino et al., 2016) and can be designed to target specific contents of the subject matter (randel, morris, & wetzel, 1992). simulation techniques are helpful to train the students achieve accuracy in low frequency events such as emergency landing procedures and processes that have irreversible outputs such as surgical procedures (damassa & sitko, 2010). parenting behavior is bi-dimensional support conduct that characterizes parental attitude towards their children (hoeve et al., 2009). positive support occurs when children experience parental warmth, acceptance, approval and responsiveness to their needs (maccoby & martin, 1983; rohner, 2004). similarly, negative support occurs when 22 children experience parental hostility, insensitivity, lack of communication and intimacy, neglect and rejection ( hoeve et al., 2009; holden, 1997; maccoby & martin, 1983; rohner, 2004; rollins & thomas, 1979). at home, parents today are providing less child-rearing guidance for their children than their own parents provided them (baumrind, 1971; zervides, 2007). this is evident in the findings of study conducted by zervide and knoles (2007) which shows that there has been a trend of changes of parental rearing styles from authoritarian to authoritative to more lenient and democratic styles (zervides, 2007). prior research has indicated those young teenagers who regard ‘parental rearing behaviors’ as being over- meddling, disciplinary, and lacking in approachability, has led to the problematic use of the internet in the youth suggesting that the influences of parenting style and family function are important factors in the development of internet dependency (mengchen & med, 2010). previous research in context to the children sustaining injuries show that many children today have access to private bedrooms (jiow & lim, 2012; olson et al., 2007), often spent considerable amount of their awake time unsupervised and unmonitored and that lessened control is often linked with increased children’s risky behaviors (harrell, 2003; morrongiello, corbett, mccourt, & johnston, 2006; morrongiello, kane, et al., 2011). such children are also likely to have access to such genres of video games that are most likely to be violent and matured content (jiow & lim, 2012; olson et al., 2007). the reasons for this could be that parents face many challenges in monitoring and supervising children because todays contemporary parents have to juggle their personal, professional life often facing adversity in face of magnifying ‘social-isolation’ and their various social professional and family commitments (“parenting today,” n.d.). these 23 challenges include limitations affecting their ability to continuously monitor children playing together or alone, both which include playing video games (livingstone, 2007; livingstone & helsper, 2008; nikken & jansz, 2006). for example, single parents or those who are time-constrained are more likely to allow video and computer games to “baby sit” their children—keeping them engaged, indoors, and occupied—but unsupervised (cauchon, 2005; harms & clifford, 1989; wilson-doenges, 2001; worley, 2011). such time-constrained parents have self-reported that they lack time and technical expertise to understand video games and are more than likely to stop monitoring and supervision over period of time, as they perceive their children to possess superior technical expertise to their own (oosting, ijsselsteijn, & kort, 2008). parents have also rationalized their indifference toward inappropriate content in video games because they believe that their children are unaffected by these games (“violent video games and young people,” 2008). according to pro cons ,videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres (“charts graphs on video games -youth violence,” 2015). table 1.2 games statistics:

suggestive themes, use of alcohol as consequences of young children being left unsupervised and unmonitored, it is likely that children engagement in inappropriate content i.e violence, blood, gore and such genres is more likely to translate in to offline behavior, which can further influence engagement of risqué behavior. children lack control supervision and monitoring not only at home but they may also face similar circumstances at schools where lack of supervision, monitoring and guidance would impact children to behave risqué in school environment. in pre-internet society, parents exercised a more dominant role in raising their children and instilling values (comer, 1993; gillies, 2008; grusec, 2002). but in contemporary society with many parents working, as parents provide less guidance for their children at home, research indicates that more parents throughout the world harbor an expectation that schools assume that dominant role—in teaching, supervising, and mentoring children’s’ behavior (dinham & scott, 2000). at school, parents today expect more child-rearing guidance be provided for their children than their schools provided them (grolnick, friendly, & bellas, 2009; steinberg, lamborn, dornbusch, & darling, 25 1992; usher & kober, 2012; zervides, 2007). parents thus harbor expectations from the schools to provide the necessary supervision to their children. although parents still want their children to mature into responsible citizens, in the contemporary societies, parents expect the school authorities to assume most of the responsibility towards this goal expecting the schools to do most of the work associated with imparting knowledge as well as values (comer, 1993; delattre & delattre, 2005). however parents are reluctant to allow schools to take disciplinary actions against their children (barge & loges, 2003; ferrara & ferrar, 2005; georgiou, 2008). as a result of this school children are often likely to receive little or no discipline what so ever (ferrara & ferrar, 2005). school environments thus are often less effective in fulfilling the expectation of contemporary parents in the area of being able to teach basic values to their children and thus are ineffective in fulfilling the expectation of the society in large (edmonds, 1979; mcevoy & welker, 2000; olweus, 1994). lack of disciplinary actions from school authorities can lead to increase in disruptive behaviors in school (nelson, martella, & galand, 1998). studies also have indicated students have engaged in menacing actions, including stalking, bullying, physical or verbal assaults, and “hijacking” classrooms (kuhlenschmidt & layne, 1999; schneider, 1998), which makes understanding this behavior important in context to our research. overall, sociologists and legal authorities indicate that contemporary children receive less than adequate disciplinary guidance or supervision at home or at school (ferrara & ferrar, 2005; pang, 2009). there is yet another dimension to the disruptive behaviors of the children that is seen in public situations. less than adequate child rearing guidance at home and school is likely to influence children’s behavior in the society that can impact the citizens of the 26 society at large (ferrara & ferrar, 2005; pang, 2009). kelly ( 2007) reported in new york times an issue that exemplified disruptive and unruly behavior in a public library in new jersey community (kelly, 2007) every afternoon at maplewood middle school’s final bell, dozens of students pour across baker street to the public library. some study quietly. others, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. one recently threatened to burn down the branch library. librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day. (kelly, 2007) another example is acquisition of certain behavior traits which are deemed necessary for survival on the streets and characterizes greater approval of the use of violence, more pronounced aggression, use of rough language and tendency to ridicule parental and school authority which is popularly known as street corner sub culture (chilman, 1965; crain & weisman, 1972; hanna, 1988). child in need of services (chins), enacted in multiple states in the u.s., is defined by law as a child that is consistently absent from school, consistently disobey reasonable directions of his or her parents and teachers, is fugitive, wanders or loiters about the streets, highway, or any public place, and does something wrong (wolf & larrick, 2012).such a child is believed to be beyond the control of the parental guidance and direction and such behavior endangers the health, safety and welfare of the child (wolf & larrick, 2012). undiagnosed adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) can also lead to children behaving in such a way that could be constituted as disruptive (hallowell, n.d.). studies thus indicates that such children whose disruptive behavioral traits at large go unchecked by the guiding influences in their lives are likely to developing learning 27 difficulties, school problems, peer relationship difficulties, criminality and more severe and long-lasting mental disorders (joachim, sanders, & turner, 2010). 1.2.5 uninhibited online behavior another concern that is important from the context of this study is the uninhibited online behavior that may have implications on people’s offline behavior. research indicates that, especially with teenagers, online behavior typically is less inhibited and restrained than offline behavior. uninhibited online behavior lead from on-line risqué behavior to off-line risky behavior in impressionable young students (joseph m kayany, 1998). online smart phone dating applications like tinder, grindr, growlr, scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers (woo, 2015). thus online risqué behavior is translated in to offline risky behavior. teenagers often exhibit uninhibited online behavior, which is referred to as ‘flaming behavior’ and is defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability”(joseph m kayany, 1998). reasons are that these activities are frequently 1) invisible (as with monitoring by parents or law enforcement) (cauchon, 2005; harms & clifford, 1989; wilson-doenges, 2001; worley, 2011), 2) simulated (as with violent games) (bartholow & anderson, 2002; “charts graphs on video games -youth violence,” 2015; gentile, lynch, linder, & walsh, 2004; 28 griffiths, 1999), 3) un-attributable (as with unauthorized information or image sharing) (hu, zhang, & luo, 2016; kim, lee, sung, & choi, 2016; moncur, orzech, & neville, 2016; silic & back, 2016), and 4) and indirect (as with avoiding personal responsibility) (derlega & chaikin, 1975). uninhibited online behavior can lead to online risqué behavior that can lead to offline risky behavior. for example internet addiction disorder that can lead to obsessive-compulsive use of the internet can influence transitioning of on-line risqué behavior to off-line risky behavior in impressionable young students. 1.2.6 desirable and undesirable outcomes resulting from online behavior students using excessive internet can have desirable effects that can include information seeking, cognitive training, resulting in individuals becoming independent as well as allowing advancement of career and social connections. desirable outcomes of second nature and formation of automatic behavior from practice and drill use of the internet can be associated with the outcomes that assist offline cognitive decision making and physical performance, including distance education from grade school to post graduate levels, professional training, and behavioral modification (eastmond, 1995a, 1995b; matthews, 1999; moore & kearsley, 2011; robst, 2007; vrasidas, 2000) students using excessive internet can result in adverse effects. individuals can experience online influence of undesirable behaviors, which is common in games, blogs, instant messaging, texting, etc. (chalfen, 2009; günsoy, cross, sarıbay, olcaysoy ökten, & kurutaş, 2015; peluchette & karl, 2010; shah, 2010). previous cross sectional study that investigated students excessive internet usage reveals that adverse effects include anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), extreme personality 29 traits, alcohol abuse (weinstein & lejoyeux, 2010). previous studies have indicated that students experiencing higher level of anxiety are more likely to experience higher levels of apathy, feeling of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness(sashittal, jassawalla, & markulis, 2012). fave and massimini (2005) defines apathy as “the lack of attention, concentration, and control leading to disruption in consciousness and to the waste of psychic resources and skills,”(delle fave & massimini, 2005). jassawala et al. ( 2008) describes social disconnectedness as the extent to which students experiences disengagement, loneliness, and distance from their peers in their social environment (jassawalla, malshe, & sashittal, 2008). another effect of excessive internet leads to low academic performance (huang et al., 2009; park, kang, & kim, 2014), which was also the effect on students that got bored with increased magnitude and frequency and sought sensation seeking activities on the internet (skues, williams, oldmeadow, & wise, 2016; yang, zhu, chen, song, & wang, 2016). these students have unlimited access to fantasy games and different tools that can keep the imaginations and adrenaline constantly charged (allison, wahlde, & shockley, 2006; asgari & kaufman, 2004; holtz & appel, 2011; silvern & williamson, 1987; allison et al., 2006). using the appropriate technological tools available to them, young adolescents can talk about their fantasies in blogs, social medias, and communicate these ideas and fantasies with their peers (allison et al., 2006). studies have also reported that excessive internet use has resulted in shorter sleep duration resulting in sleep deprivation, exhaustion, and ill health (do, shin, bautista, & foo, 2013). excessive internet use has also caused adverse effects on student’s dietary behavior (yeonsoo kim et al., 2010), partner interaction anxiety (odac & kalkan, 30 2010), greater probabilities of suicidal ideation and attempt (yeonsoo kim et al., 2010; lin et al., 2014) undesired behavior also can be observed in young students when they exhibit confrontational behaviors in the classroom resulting in disruption of the class discipline (kitishat & al-friehat, 2013). disruption in class room can include students playing video games and when confronted for their activities becoming hostile (ali & gracey, 2013, p. 2; hubbell, 2010, p. 1). pathological internet use has significant correlations with depression (75%), anxiety (57%), adhd symptoms (100%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (66%) and aggression (66%). pathological internet use is more common in males than in females (sinkkonen, puhakka, & meriläinen, 2014). cyber bullying has been described as chronic damage inflicted via the usage of computer systems and other digital devices (hinduja & patchin, 2011). this conduct can include harassing messages, derogatory feedback on a web website online, or intimidating or threatening someone in diverse on-line settings of public boards, video games, blogs, or social networking web sites (burgess-proctor, patchin, & hinduja, 2009). previous research in keeping with wegge et al. (2014) reveals that “digital forms of bullying often take place among people who know one another in actual lifestyles, together with schoolmates, implying that they'll be concerned in more than one varieties of social in addition to bullying interactions”(wegge, vandebosch, & eggermont, 2014, p. 428 ). as indicated by mckenna et al. (2002), teenagers and young adults, often mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior, this means that it is likely that cyber bullying also influences traditional bullying, and such an assumption is consistent with current research. 31 people that use online dating applications use these applications excessively and addictively developing dating anxieties in an online medium. excessive internet use for dating applications can become addictive leading to feeling of helplessness (young, 1999), and with concerns to the privacy of their personal information, have an attitude of online apathy when faced with the alternative of not using the internet (hargittai, 2016). popular media as well as empirical studies indicate that users get addicted to online dating applications like tinder, ok cupid leads to offline partner anxiety and apathy towards social connectedness and offline dating impacting their real relationships in offline environment (odac & kalkan, 2010; tigar, 2015). one study revealed that high stages of tension amongst college students who are connected with each other in some formal relationship such as class team projects, or competing for high grades or coveted membership to an academic or social club would result in disconnectedness amongst themselves in otherwise social setting. over period of time this social disconnectedness leads to the feeling of powerlessness that can lead to excessive use of the internet generating apathy amongst students (sashittal et al., 2012). findings of another study revealed those high-school students who were heavy internet users exhibited confrontational and other disruptive behaviors in the classroom (kitishat & al-friehat, 2013). 1.2.7 undesirable effects of problematic internet use (piu) excessive use of the internet by young adults leads to negative offline behavior, such as increased aggression, increased anxiety, increased apathy, feelings of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness (sashittal et al., 2012). for example, in 32 online scenarios, users may exhibit aggression causing or resulting from cyberbullying (athanasiades, kamariotis, psalti, baldry, & sorrentino, 2015) increased anxiety can result from dating misgivings (young, 1999),, users may harbor online apathy toward others’ information privacy (hargittai, 2016), users may experience feelings of powerlessness due to loss social influence (odac & kalkan, 2010; tigar, 2015), and users may experience social disconnectedness resulting from a combination of all of these issues (s. e. jones, 2014; urbanski, 2007). the problem of habitual or addictive use of the internet goldberg (1995) further described internet addiction disorder (iad) as having the same four measures as substance abuse : tolerance, withdrawal , craving and negative life consequences which describes the problematic use of the internet (z. w. lee & cheung, 2014). it is likely that problematic internet use (shapira, goldsmith, keck, khosla, & mcelroy, 2000), leads to media addiction(larose, lin, & eastin, 2003) where marlatt et al. ( 1988) defines addiction as “a repetitive habit pattern that increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems…often experienced subjectively as “loss of control” [that] continues despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use” (marlatt, baer, & donovan, 1988, p.224). “a habit, from the standpoint of psychology, is a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience” (andrews, 1903, p. 1). these new habits over period of time become automatic and the process is referred to as habit formation. habit formation is always in context. popular media reported an instance of addiction of playing online video-game “world of war craft” that resulted in unemployment, loss of social life, and neglect to personal hygiene impacting general health and well-being negatively 33 (schmitz & hopper, 2012). excessive use of the internet by young adults can produce such as increased aggression, increased anxiety, increased apathy, feelings of powerlessness, and social disconnectedness (sashittal et al., 2012). for example, in online scenarios, users may exhibit aggression causing or resulting from cyberbullying (athanasiades et al., 2015) increased anxiety can result from dating misgivings (young, 1999); users may harbor online apathy toward others’ information privacy (hargittai, 2016), users may experience feelings of powerlessness due to loss social influence (odac & kalkan, 2010; tigar, 2015), and users may experience social disconnectedness resulting from a combination of all of these issues (s. e. jones, 2014; urbanski, 2007). likewise, in offline scenarios, users may exhibit physically aggressive behavior toward people who have bullied them online (dehue, bolman, & völlink, 2008), increased anxiety toward physical relationships can result from online dating misgivings (caplan, 2003; schwartz & southern, 2000), users may become more willing to gossip with acquaintances after shaming others once they have become inured to shaming them online (nycyk, 2015) , users may be driven to sickness or death if they are removed from social influence and from their former friends (steptoe, shankar, demakakos, & wardle, 2013). therefore, research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highly-undesirable offline behavior and even tragic results (“jessica logan,” 2015, “ryan halligan: the story,” 2015, “the tragic megan meier story,” 2015, “the tragic story of tyler clementi,” 2015). 1.3 purpose current study, facebook and is relevance not much research has been conducted on impetuous impression management or 34 the reasons for teenager and young adults for impetuous risqué impression projection in an online environment and more specifically in facebook. this research therefore proposes to study the factors that influences people impetuous image projection on facebook. the purpose of this research is to fill the identified research gap. sidorova et al. (2008) identified how information technology (it) systems are developed and how individuals, groups, organizations, and markets interact with it (sidorova, evangelopoulos, valacich, & ramakrishnan, 2008). therefore, research on facebook corresponds to one of the core research areas of it systems as identified by sidorova et al. (2008), namely how groups interact with it (sidorova et al., 2008). as a group ware technology that relies on the interaction between their users, facebook has generated tremendous value due to its vast expansion of its user-generated network (xu, ryan, prybutok, & wen, 2012). for example a study that looked at the value of social networking in universities found that social networking is a valuable tool that the universities can harness to help their students network professionally for job placements after they graduate (hayden, kitchens, & macleod, 2010). facebook has proved to be a learning artifact that can promote the social constructivist framework that explores the social interactions amongst the users (ractham, kaewkitipong, & firpo, 2012) which constitutes another core research area of is (vessey, ramesh, & glass, 2002). wilson et al. (2012) categorized previous research conducted on facebook into various themes such as 1. descriptive analysis of facebook users 2. the motivation of facebook users 3. the identity presentation on facebook 4. the role of facebook in social interactions 35 5. facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues (r. wilson, gosling, & graham, 2012) 6. facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues (koohikamali, peak, & prybutok, n.d.) relevant literature in psychology and cyber psychology has looked at issues related to anonymity, catharsis and autonomy related to unrestrained behavior in offline environment (christopherson, 2007; derlega & chaikin, 1975). not much study has been conducted on impetuous behaviors and the effect of the impression management on facebook. because impetuous online leads to potentially dangerous offline suggestive behavior (benotsch, snipes, martin, & bull, 2013), which can result in tragic consequences (“jessica logan,” 2015, “ryan halligan: the story,” 2015, “the tragic megan meier story,” 2015, “the tragic story of tyler clementi,” 2015), this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems .the above discussion informs that impetuous risqué behavior generally falls into the undesirable outcomes of online activities of the users of facebook. 1.3.1 impetuous and risky behaviors this research considers two kinds of behavior, impetuous and risky-- in both online and offline environments; however, this study focuses on impetuous behavior. an example of impetuous behavior is the risqué behavior which is “slightly indecent and liable to shock, especially by being sexually suggestive” (“oxford dictionaries- risque,” 2016). common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting (lohmann, 2011; roberts, 2012). 36 risky behavior encompasses the possibility of danger, failure, or loss (“oxford dictionaries- risky,” 2016). as such both behaviors exist in online and offline environments with overlapping, but often distinct, consequences (benotsch et al., 2013). 1.3.2 impetuous online/offline versus risky online/offline behaviors impetuous and risky online behaviors contribute to negative risqué and risky offline behaviors. this research therefore defines impetuous online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment e.g. sexting (lohmann, 2011), flaming (kayany, 1998). similarly in this study impetuous offline behavior is defined as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting, and scandalous behavior that includes being sexually provocative, or being offensive, rude, hostile in an offline environment (wilson & brazendale, 1973), substance use, violent behavior, early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults (beets et al., 2009), truancy, bullying, insubordination, disrespect, tardiness, fighting, stealing, and vandalism (brown & levinson, 1987). risky online behavior is behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. cyber security breaches (landwehr et al., 2012) and online espionage (flusche, 2001; schneier, 2014) are instances of risky online behavior risky offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude, e.g., social engineering (luo, brody, seazzu, & burd, 2013), competitive car 37 racing that can result in accidents (gullone, moore, moss, & boyd, 2000), high risk sexual behavior (benotsch et al., 2013) are instances of potentially dangerous offline behaviors. 1.3.3 impetuous online leading to potentially dangerous offline results another study found that excessive amounts of “sexting” was robustly linked with “substance use and high-risk sexual behavior, including having multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex, and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections” (benotsch et al., 2013). online smart phone dating applications like tinder, grindr, growlr, scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers (woo, 2015). impetuous behavior can be hazardous to this population for two reasons: 1) younger users invest a lot of time in the internet, particularly in its social features (burnay, billieux, blairy, & laroi, 2015; laconi, tricard, & chabrol, 2015; lu & yeo, 2015) and, 2) a significant number these younger users engage in risqué online behaviors, i.e., behaviors that are considered undesirable, provocative, and/or high-risk in current society (black, stone, & johnson, 2015; peluchette & karl, 2010; shah, 2010; wahdan, nimr, kotb, & wahdan, 2014). a concern of this research is that 1 and 2 can cyclically reinforce and feed each other, yielding accumulating, undesirable results for individuals and for society. this research seeks to break this cycle and to prevent its recurrence. 1.3.4 suggestive risqué or negative online behavior risqué is behavior that “slightly indecent and liable to shock, especially by being 38 sexually suggestive”(“oxford dictionaries,” n.d.). common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting (lohmann, 2011; roberts, 2012; “what is ‘sexting’? nude or risque pics sent by teens expose them to serious legal and social consequences.,” 2009). this research therefore defines risqué online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment. it is mostly indecent (as in sexting, flirting), and scandalous behavior (as in posting provocative images) in an online environment . risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“definition of risqué,” n.d.). example risqué behavior includes ‘flaming behavior’ which has been defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability (kayany, 1998). 1.3.4.1 suggestive risqué offline behavior this study defines suggestive risqué offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent (as in flirting), and scandalous behavior (being sexually provocative, or being offensive, rude, hostile) in an offline environment. this type of behavior has been extensively described in popular as well as academic literatures. wilson and brazendale (1973) conducted a study where they described appropriation of suggestive offline behavior by conducting an experiment that involved 39 using what they described as risqué slides of seaside postcards based largely on sexual innuendo to administer a humor test (g. d. wilson & brazendale, 1973). recently, the wall street journal reported another instance of suggestive risqué offline behavior. it has been brought to our attention by building management and security that the stairwells are being used inappropriately.... cigarettes, plastic cups filled with beer, and several used condoms were found in the stairwell. yes, you read that right. do not use the stairwells to smoke, drink, eat, or have sex. please respect building and company policy and use common sense... (winkler r, 2016) another instance of offline suggestive behavior includes demeaning derogatory sexually suggestive behavior towards teachers in classroom (oluwole, 2015) 1.3.4.2 dangerous risky online behavior oxford dictionary defines risky as “full of the possibility of danger, failure, or loss”(“oxford dictionaries- risky,” n.d.). this research defines ‘dangerous risky online behavior’ as behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. for example risks associated with online trading has been discussed in details in academic literature (fan & chen, 2005; looney, akbulut, & poston, 2008). risks associated with online gambling has also been discussed extensively in academic literature (fishburn & kochenberger, 1979; krueger & dickson, 1994). 1.3.4.3 dangerous risky offline behavior this research defines dangerous risky offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible 40 failure or loss of some tangible magnitude. risky behavior is indecent , and scandalous behavior (meeting people for casual sexual encounters, having relationship/s outside matrimony) in an offline environment . it is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy. high risk sexual behaviors have been discussed extensively in academic literature (d’arcy & devaraj, 2012; vakharia, 2013). risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior. risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare, and involving acts of substance use. risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence, street fights, and bar fights i.e. any act that is anti-social. 1.3.4.4 risqué impression behavior this research defines risqué behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment. it is mostly indecent (as in sexting, flirting), and scandalous behavior (as in posting provocative images) in an online environment. risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“definition of risqué,” n.d.). example risqué behavior includes ‘flaming behavior’ which has been defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility, such as swearing, calling names, ridiculing, and hurling insults towards another person, his/her character, religion, race, intelligence, and physical or mental ability (kayany, 1998). 41 this research defines risky behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment. risky behavior is indecent, and scandalous behavior (meeting people for casual sexual encounters, having relationship/s outside matrimony,) in an offline environment. it is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy. risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior. risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare, vandalism, involving acts of substance use. risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence, street fights, bar fights i.e. any act that is anti-social. risqué behavior is defined as indecent and scandalous behavior. it is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy (“definition of risqué,” n.d.). popular media have acknowledged and discussed facebook users risqué content posted on facebook. for instance popular media, word of mouth, and social media marketing reported the ‘computer babies post’ posted by intel which can be categorized as risqué content that went viral immediately indicating, that users post risqué content to their facebook profile which allows them instant popularity (h. morris, 2012). other popular media have discussed whether risqué content should be allowed or not on facebook (brown, 2013; “facebook’s ‘porn cops,’” 2010; shapira, n.d.). however, there is not much empirical study conducted on this wide observed behavior pattern of facebook users. impression management thus assumes central position in this research because this work emphasizes the importance of shaping teenager personalities to become well-adapted and productive citizens in future technological society. impression management has been extensively researched in sociology and psychology disciplines 42 (krämer & winter, 2008). the framework has been applied in various practical applications as public relations (piwinger & ebert, 2001), forensic literature (perri & lichtenwald, 2010), in the area of sports and psychology (ginis, lindwall, & prapavessis, 2007) and offline social behaviors like eating disorders(herman, roth, & polivy, 2003). facebook has also been researched extensively (wilson et al., 2012) 1.3.5 teenage behavior and gaming dill and dill (1999) showed that there are factors that influence the relationship between video games and increased violence. video games that harness the violence-appeal are built on instant gratification. there is an instant reward or penalty for carrying out the violent act in a game. for instance, a ‘kill‘ segment will instantly gain the user with a jackpot reward or allow the user to continue to the next level. here the gamer identifies with the character in the game in first person. these emblematic aggressions impact the psychology of the player as the player controls the character of the game and therefore the player experiences the act of aggression as seen through the eyes of the character in the game (dill & dill, 1999). understanding the impact of video games on student’s psyche is also important from the is discipline perspective. 1.3.5.1 how is gaming relevant to information systems? gaming is in many ways relevant to is and this study because this work recognizes a convergence of is user and gaming user requirements. entertainment software association (esa) reported that of 155 million americans that played videogames, 26% 43 of the gamers are less than 18 years of age and an average of 6.5 hrs. per week are spend playing with others online indicating that today’s teenagers are heavily influenced by video games (“esa,” 2015). according to walsh (2000), research on absence of parental supervision reveals that such parents almost do not check the ratings of the videogames that are purchased by the children (carnagey & anderson, 2004). according to procons, videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres (“charts graphs on video games -youth violence,” 2015) .further research indicates that violent video games desensitize children at an early age to the effects of violence (carnagey, anderson, & bushman, 2007). research also indicates that it is possible for undeveloped minds of the children to get heavily influenced by these violent themes (gunter, 1998). research further indicates this influence induced by the content of the violence in the games can lead to acts of violence and aggression (sherry, 2001).thus some of the impacts when parents do not supervise their children’s offline behavior includes increased violent and aggressive behavior, increased high-risk behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use, and accelerated onset of sexual activity (villani, 2001). novelty and richness of the user experience is central concept in games technology (klimmt, roth, vermeulen, vorderer, & roth, 2016). gaming technologies thus are assuming central focus in the is research that involves teamwork of experts of different teams (nandhakumar et al., 2013). technologies that drive gaming, such as animation, visualization, interaction, and immersive technologies have been used by is in building business applications (arbaugh et al., 2009; kohun & wood, 2004), e.g., human resources use training methods like gaming, simulation, action-based learning 44 and training-on-the-job in their training and development of employees (bergenhenegouwen, 1996). is is no longer focused on functional aspects of business, but now engages the ‘user experience (ux)’ to interactive gaming technology (kulshreshth & laviola, 2015). for example integrated 3-dui technologies (stereoscopic 3d, head tracking, and finger-count gestures) enhances user performance and improved gaming experience (kulshreshth & laviola, 2015). a study that investigated factors predicting the use of smart phone based augment reality takes its theoretical inspiration from the technology acceptance model (kim & hyun, 2016), that links augmented reality research to core information system research. we also find that gaming applications have extended is user community beyond business world to other professions, such as engineering (bekebrede, lo, & lukosch, 2015), education (katsaliaki & mustafee, 2014), environmental studies (sterman et al., 2015), policy sciences (de caluwé, geurts, & kleinlugtenbelt, 2012). businesses have been using gaming technologies to aid their business processes. communication and information technologies such as virtual reality and augmented realities have been used in health care industry. serious games (sr) have recently been developed which has proven effective in treatment of specific phobias (botella et al., 2011; wrzesien et al., 2015). computer supported collaborative learning is a pedagogical tool that has been used for implementing educational games in the classroom (echeverría et al., 2012). augmented reality games through mobile technology are being used in primary and secondary education enhancing student formal or informal learning (koutromanos, sofos, & avraamidou, 2015). 45 1.3.5.2 how is gaming relevant to this research? system software concepts encompasses human computer interaction and thus is one of the main sub disciplines categorized under is research (vessey, ramesh, & glass, 2002, p.139,142). as research in interaction design technologies matured, researchers and practitioners started looking at ‘user experience (ux)’ as viable substitute to the already saturated discipline of human computer interaction research (hassenzahl & tractinsky, 2006). gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies (ericsson et al., 1993; maddux, johnson, & willis, 2001). previous research on practice shows that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. user will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (ericsson et al., 1993). practice leads to automatic behavior and is characterized by efficiency, lack of awareness, un-intentionality, and uncontrollability (bargh, 1994). this automatic behavior is to referred to as second nature (konijn, 2000). repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior. the direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature (konijn, 2000) is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set (bargh, 1994) and by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment. gaming will thus impact transition of online risqué behavior to offline risky behavior tipping the balance in favor of criminal mindset thus 46 upsetting the equilibrium and balance that modern society enjoys. gaming represents an avenue to understand impression management in an is context. research has shown that innovative development of digital technologies especially gaming technologies are centralized over human carnal pleasures (lahti, 2003). previous studies conducted on success of sportsmen shows that amount of sports practice by the sports practitioner is positively correlated with the success achieved (gimeno & garcía-mas, 2010). this correlates achievements of goals to the repetitive practice. gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies. the online environment that involves a dangerous or criminal fantasy can thus have problematic implications (anderson & bushman, 2001; anderson & dill, 2000; funk, baldacci, pasold, & baumgardner, 2004; prensky, 2006; przybylski, ryan, & rigby, 2009). interactive video games that combine physical exercise with gameplay and are called exergames. active technologies or exergames are primitive augmented reality applications and were invented that allowed the gamers to use a wireless remote controller, a wireless device that the gamer will hold the device and the technology induces the dynamic physical somatic movements of the hand of the gamer on to the video screen (millington, 2009). user interface embodiment refers to the degree to which the user’s body interacts with the game. a study has revealed that user interface embodiment has enhanced the user’s experience, which basically reflects the user’s involvement in the game. study also revealed that enjoyment experienced by the users increases the intentions of the user to further engage in playing those games (kim, prestopnik, & biocca, 2014). previous research on practice shows that the act of 47 repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. users will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (ericsson et al., 1993). drills are the software that are intended to allow the user to practice a skill set (maddux, johnson, & willis, 2001). “a habit, from the standpoint of psychology, is a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience” (andrews, 1903, p. 1). it is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior (neal et al., 2006). these new habits over period of time become automatic and the process is referred to as habit formation. habit formation is always in context. as behaviors are repeated in a context the link between the context and the behavior strengthens and over period of time, when an event occurs that triggers the context, the behavior linked with the context is automatically performed. this forms the automaticity of the behavior in the context (wood & neal, 2007). research has shown that innovative development of digital technologies especially gaming technologies are centralized over human carnal pleasures (lahti, 2003). previous studies conducted on success of sportsmen shows that amount of sports practice by the sports practitioner is positively correlated with the success achieved (gimeno & garcía-mas, 2010). this correlates achievements of goals to the repetitive practice. gaming applications embraces behavior, psychology, training, drill and practice, and advanced immersive, technologies. previous research on practice shows that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set results in improving, grasping learning a skill set or behavior. user will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature (ericsson et al., 48 1993). repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior the direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature which is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment. the online environment that involves a dangerous or criminal fantasy can thus have problematic implications (anderson & bushman, 2001; anderson & dill, 2000; funk et al., 2004; prensky, 2006; przybylski et al., 2009). 1.3.5.3 how is gaming relevant to impression management? gaming influences the goal relevance of the user’s impression motivation, which is a dimension of impression motivation (ericsson et al., 1993; gimeno & garcía-mas, 2010; leary & kowalski, 1990; pintrich, 2000; schlenker, forsyth, leary, & miller, 1980). there are two variables in impression management, impression motivation (the predictor), and impression construction (the dependent variable). expectancy-value approach to ‘self-presentation’ suggests that people are motivated to project images that can get them the maximum returns and allows people to manipulate trade offs between costs and rewards as they deal with their impression management on other people (schlenker et al., 1980). leary and kowalski (1990) described goal relevance of impressions as an antecedent to impression motivation. these researchers linked achievement of relevant goals that includes social and material outcomes as factors that influences impression motivation (leary & kowalski, 1990). 49 1.3.6 teenage behavior and facebook 1.3.6.1 how is facebook relevant to information systems? facebook in its own right has proved to be a learning artifact that can promote the social constructivist framework that explores the social interactions amongst the users (ractham et al., 2012) which constitutes one of the core research area of is (vessey et al., 2002). in this study we have concentrated on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by studying how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online risqué behavior of students on social networking sites, and in this way, our paper represents a mainstream area of information science (is) research and contributes to the development of the discipline. 1.3.6.2 why facebook is relevant to this research to address the issues related to uncertainty associated with facebook research, wilson et al. (2012) studied and identified 412 peer reviewed research articles on facebook literature. this work categorizes this previous research into six distinct themes. 1) the descriptive analysis of facebook users, which is captured by responses answering who are facebook users and how do they use facebook (judd & kennedy, 2010; kirman, lawson, & linehan, 2009; lampe, ellison, & steinfield, 2008; m. lee, weng, lin, & ma, 2011; mccorkindale, 2010; nguyen & tran, 2011; ryan & xenos, 2011) 2) the motivation of facebook users, which is captured by responses answering why people use facebook (amichai-hamburger & vinitzky, 2010; baek, holton, harp, & yaschur, 2011; cheung, chiu, & lee, 2011; ross, orr, sisic, 50 & arseneault, 2009; j. underwood, kerlin, & farrington-flint, 2011; wang, moon, kwon, & evans, 2010) 3) the identity presentation on facebook, which is captured by responses answering how people present themselves on facebook (hum, chamberlin, & hambright, 2011; j. d. m. j. underwood, kerlin, & farrington-flint, 2011; wang et al., 2010; zhao, grasmuck, & martin, 2008; zhao et al., 2008) 4) the role of facebook in social interactions, which is captured by responses answering how facebook impacts relationships among groups and individuals (bohnert & ross, 2010; darvell, walsh, & white, 2011; karl, peluchette, & schlaegel, 2010a; kirschner & karpinski, 2010; mutawa, awadhi, & baggili, 2011) 5) facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues, which is captured by responses answering why people disclose personal information on facebook despite potential risks (fogel & nehmad, 2009; nosko, wood, & molema, 2010; n. park, jin, & jin, 2011; stutzman, capra, & thompson, 2011; tang, wang, xiong, yang, & hu, 2011) 6) facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues, which is captured by responses answering why people disclose other peoples’ information on facebook despite potential risks (koohikamali, peak, & prybutok, n.d.). relevant literature in psychology and cyber psychology has looked at issues related to anonymity, catharsis and autonomy related to unrestrained behavior in offline environment (christopherson, 2007; derlega & chaikin, 1975). psychology has also addressed impression management at length in an offline environment (baumeister, 51 bratslavsky, & muraven, 1998; baumeister & leary, 1995; goffman, 1978; leary, 1995; leary & baumeister, 2000; leary & kowalski, 1990; leary, tchividijian, & kraxberger, 1994; morris & feldman, 1996; tang et al., 2011; valenzuela, park, & kee, 2009a). facebook personal privacy and information disclosure issues’ is a theme which is captured by responses answering why people disclose personal information on facebook despite potential risks (fogel & nehmad, 2009; nosko et al., 2010; park et al., 2011; stutzman et al., 2011; tang et al., 2011). ‘facebook others privacy and information disclosure issues’ is another theme which is captured by responses answering why people disclose other peoples’ information on facebook despite potential risks (koohikamali, peak, & prybutok, n.d.). 1.3.6.3 why facebook is relevant to impression management previous research in psychology describes three goals that motivates people to manage their impressions when they perceive that those impressions are relevant to fulfilment of those goals (leary, 1995; leary & kowalski, 1990). people engage in self presentation as a means of creating their identities (baumeister, 1982; gollwitzer, 1986). they are also motivated to maintain and enhance their self-esteem (jones, 1973; morris rosenberg, schooler, schoenbach, & rosenberg, 1995) and they use impression management to acquire their desired social and material wants (schlenker, 1980; tedeschi, 2013). as already discussed in the above section, facebook is used by people for acquiring social desired outcomes as described in theme 4; and for identity presentation as described in theme 3. facebook has also been studied extensively in the context of self esteem (błachnio, przepiorka, & pantic, 2016; greitemeyer, 2016; 52 skues, williams, & wise, 2012; subramanian, wise, davis, bhandari, & morris, 2014; tazghini & siedlecki, 2013) 1.3.6.4 relevance of impression management to is vessey et al. (2002) lists the topics that are studies under is research (vessey et al., 2002). some of those topics include systems/software management concepts (project management, risk management, personnel issues); problems domain specific concepts (information systems including group support systems); organizational concepts (strategies, cultural implications); societal concepts (cultural implications, ethical implications) (vessey et al., 2002). these topics can be linked to the topics studied under impression management (im). leary and kowalski (1990) describe im to have consisted of topics such as goal relevance of impressions, value of desired goals, discrepancy between desired and current image, impression construction, construct of self, desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, targets value and current or potential image. it is concluded that impression management covers a wide spectrum of core research areas in information systems. impression management can thus be seen to have a direct relevance to is research. 1.3.7 groupware technology when technologies are designed in such a way that they serve the purpose of facilitating human interactions with the system rather than systems being used to solve some problems, they are called groupware systems. “groupware is defined as computer based systems that supports groups of people engaged in a common task or goals and 53 that provide an interface to a shared environment” (ellis, gibbs, & rein, 1991). christopherson (2007) studied influences of anonymity in computer-mediated communication (cmc) and sia et.al. (2002) study that looked at group polarization using groupware conferencing apparatus that utilized text based communications indicates that facebook is groupware technology. 1.4 problem statement the usage of sns and the computer mediated communication media has been appropriated beyond its intended use. this study concentrates on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by exploring how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online behavior of students on social networking sites, and in this way, our paper represents a mainstream area of information science (is) research and contributes to the development of the discipline. this study attempts to study the impression motivation which is the awareness that facebook is being used for uses other than the intended uses on the image construction which is the behavior exhibited through their online profile images. the current research proposes to investigate balancing of the tradeoff between perceived privacy concerns and an active social media presence. the proposed generalized research question of this dissertation is “do active social media presence and various privacy concerns have any influence on student’s online behaviors on social media?” this research will investigate this question in three different studies as following: essay 1 investigates impression management theory as applied to social networking. the growth of social networking sites in the last few years has changed the 54 pattern of its utility thereby providing yet another new social phenomenon. essay 1 focus on the business implications by investigating the intention of recruiting managers to use social networking sites like facebook and myspace to conduct checks on prospective job candidates. also, school authorities and law enforcement have occasionally used facebook evidence for taking actions because they have been able to confirm or trace of criminal activities. using the framework of impression management theory, this study examines how online behavior of students is related to visibility awareness, social networking site information trust, and awareness of various features of technology. essay 1 thus examines if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as visibility awareness and privacy concerns which is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave responsibly which is operationalized as responsible image on social media. in essay 2, i extend essay 1 and fill in the research gap to investigate the negative impression management of students on facebook. i focus on the risks associated with negative or risqué online behavior of students that can get mimicked to risky offline behaviors often leading to tragic results. using the framework of impression management theory, i examine how negative online behavior of students is related to students portraying different personalities by selectively disclosing their personas aided by awareness of various privacy features of technology. essay 2 thus explores if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as selective disclosure, and desired differential personas and privacy concerns that is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave negatively which is operationalized as negative or risqué image on social media. 55 in essay 3, i extend the conceptual framework of essay 1 and look at trust and privacy of social networking while investigating factors influencing student behavior on facebook in the context of impression management. with this study, i aim to extend the previous studies by using the framework of trust in digital information to investigate privacy and security concerns related to the use of social networking. this essay is still a work in progress and i am in the process of analyzing data. essay 3 researches if factors such as dimensions of active social media presence such as impression motivation and information trustworthiness and privacy concerns operationalized as technology awareness influences students to have distinct impression management operationalized as image construction on social media. my investigation shows that the impression management framework serves as the most important base model for predictors of social networking behaviors to increase the awareness of information and cyber security in order to promote the best security practices. each essay has been built by reviewing the existing literature in social networking, cyber security and information systems theories to increase the awareness of privacy and security concerns related with problematic use of the internet. the research and the frameworks posited, allow us to identify relevant concerns and directions for further research. my work posits and supports new theory development and shows the overarching importance of researching privacy and security in social network analysis as a major organizational construct. 1.5 research design the rest of this study is organized as below. the next section describes 56 generalized literature review that discusses the periphery of the problem area. the three research essays follow this. each research essay is organized with its own introduction, literature review, statement of hypotheses, research model, methodology, proposed instruments, data analysis, discussion and implications and limitations.",1 chapter 1 introduction and problem statement 11 subject area 111 importance of social media research webbased social networking is in a general sense changing the way we interact team up appropriate and create they signify the most effective change driven results of information technology on businesses impacted by professional and personal lives of the stakeholders aral dellarocas  godes 2013 social networking is a ubiquitous phenomenon it has percolated not only the personal lives of its users but it has also impacted the professional domains thereby making its way in to the main stream business discipline enforced public visibility is the direct consequences of the omnievolving appropriation of social media an example of user being forced to use social media can be an online job portal like linkedin or facebook that helps people to stay connected with their friends and families recent studies indicate that people have started appropriating social media in aiding their businesses kaplan  haenlein 2010b kärkkäinen jussila  väisänen 2010 treem  leonardi 2013 dutta 2010 argues that every businessperson must now have a personal social media strategy today’s leaders must embrace social media for three reasons first they provide a lowcost platform on which to build your personal brand communicating who you are both within and outside your company second they allow you to engage rapidly and simultaneously with peers employees customers and the broader public especially younger generations in the same transparent and direct way they expect from everyone in their lives third they give you an opportunity to learn from instant information and unvarnished feedback dutta 2010 p 2 research in social media includes investigating activities of its users and the level of those investigations aral et al 2013 classifies areas of activities in to four broad 2 categories namely “design and features strategy and tactics management  organization and measurement  value at three levels namely consumers and society platforms and intermediaries and firms and industries” aral et al 2013 p 4 i am addressing the problem domain that broadly considers intersection of design  features of social media analyzed at the level of and platforms and intermediaries research associated with design and features includes investigating the appropriation of features of social networking by different stakeholders such as individuals in social context and individuals in context of business users this category depicts how patrons companies and governments use explicit social media features and how these technologies are made available to the users at the same time design research also considers how constrains can be enforced to prevent misappropriation of the same features thus design looks in to standardizing and regulating the various facets of social media development and implementation individuals businesses or governments are the users of social media which constitutes platforms and intermediaries that continuously innovate and grow using the platform of social media such as twitter facebook etc aral et al 2013 have listed some of the research agendas which lie in the intersection of my research domain of interest they are • how can users optimize their use of social media • which objectives do users pursue in using social media • how can users create relationships curate information broaden their reach and maximize their influence • what are the benefits and risks associated with use of social media • what is the nonmonetary value that social media create eg equality health violence civic engagement 3 • how do specific features and designs help platforms attract users create engagement enable and constrain user behavior and increase revenue • how can platforms maximize their influence and revenue • should platforms be open or closed standardized or ad hoc aral et al 2013 process of social interactions is complex and governed by societal norms social media features are designed and developed in such a way that they enforce constraints on the user behavior to conform to the societal norms social media thus exhibit candid impact on the societal framework aral et al 2013 social media is the futuristic phenomenon intricately associated with human behavior and in the emerging era of the internet of things its understanding has become critical for new directions in development of technologies one of the emerging trends of the appropriation of social media includes the talent acquisition process where companies have started appropriating social networks to track talent to match to the open positions aral et al 2013 linkedin is one such example where a service that began as a job portal emerged in to a social media where the jobseekers do not have to pay for registration and create a profile garg and telang 2011 reported that “features in linkedin such as connections which can either be further classified as weak or strong serves different purposes weak ties help the individual to come across a job lead while the strong ties and first connection helps an individual to get job interview as well as job offer” garg  telang 2011 the site slowly developed to include features that encouraged the job seekers to update much more information than just their resume the features of endorsing skills which essentially is a part of social network analysis is appropriated by the employers to gather much more information about the candidate to be able to perform a close fit of the talent to the open positions premium services are created both for the job seekers and the employers 4 hence it is thus seen that many job portals have emerged in to becoming social networking sites the concept being social networking encourages users to upload much more social information in context of the talent acquisition this makes more information available to both the parties the job seekers and the employers on one hand jobseekers gain more information such as average salaries that a position can command best working conditions perks and benefits and so on on the other hand the employers can gather much more information about the candidate apart which gives them the ability to match the right candidate to the right job this kind of appropriation has transformed the job portals into something much more giving the service providers competitive edge w kim jeong  lee 2010 schwartz 2013 evolution of social media in this direction gives rise to the considerations that users can use to strategically position themselves on the social media in order to realize their goals pertaining to their career choices research in social media and social networking is still in its embryonic stage and is emerging the above research has introduced my specific area of research interest in the information related phenomenon that is observed in the emergence of social media the above section also leads us to finding out why social networking is an area of interest under the discipline of information sciences 112 social networking in context of impression management social networking sites have been a focus of empirical research and have been studied from the perspective of impression management in various interdisciplinary studies such as psychology sociology computermediated communications etc 5 rosenberg and egbert 2011 studied the utility of personality traits and secondary goals as predictors of selfpresentation tactics employed by facebook users secondary goals are recurring motivations in an individual’s life and include identity goals interaction goals personal resource goals and arousal management goals dillard segrin  harden 1989 rosenberg and egbert reported that individual personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals and that secondary goals predicted the use of various selfpresentation tactics used on facebook results indicated that these personality traits and secondary goals are both theoretically and empirically sound components for the conceptualization of online impression management rosenberg  egbert 2011 this study prompts further research in self presentation on facebook considering the effect of audience segmentation and how individuals deal with problems of multiple audiences having access to their profile and being witnesses to their activity on facebook such as friends versus family members lampe ellison  steinfield 2006 lampe ellison  steinfield 2007 stutzman 2006 for instance a child may experience uncertainty when parent would want to be added to the child’s facebook page the child may not want the parent to view hisor her facebook page i have engaged this theme in my research essay where i investigated factors affecting online behavior of people living with hiv and aids on facebook where one of the construct i have looked at is the selective disclosure in context of stigma faced by people living with hiv allbright 2002 conducted a study to investigate relationship formation over computer mediated communication channels contrary to notion where physical proximity and cues such as eye contact body language etc have been seen as critical to the 6 formation of attraction this study investigates how relationships are formed online without physical proximity and cues a popular belief about online profiles is that people are more likely to construct false profiles with respect to their true age class and even gender using goffmans theory of impression management and literature on deception in communication this study compared the first impression people formed online with the second impression formed offline and the reason for any disparity in the two impressions albright reported that most people were honest with each other online and the majority of participants reported being as or more attracted to their online lovers with increased information via phone calls photos exchanged and face to face meetings most misimpressions in these relationships were the result of respondents filling in the blanks incorrectly or idealization rather than being victims of overt deception albright gives direction for future research in three areas she points out that not much research has been conducted in the areas of projection and idealization secondly she urges the researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate if these relationships are more viable long term than those formed in facetoface contexts and lastly albright recommends that further investigations are needed to assess why some relationships never move out of the online environment to a facetoface meeting albright 2002 using albrights themes one area that i have looked in to is the invisibility issue face by communities of people living with hiv and aids in context of the stigma associated with the disease i have looked at solution space for people having concerns about disclosing their identities to use sns as a platform to be able to meet other people living with hiv with the aim of forming longterm relationships in my research study titled benefits and 7 risks associated with using secret facebook support group for people living with hiv and aids snss constitute an important research context for scholars investigating processes of impression management selfpresentation and friendship performance in one of the earliest academic articles on snss boyd 2004 examined friendster as a locus of publicly articulated social networks that allowed users to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others donath  boyd 2004 donath and boyd 2004 extended this to suggest that ‘‘public displays of connection’’ serve as important identity signals that help people navigate the networked social world in that an extended network may serve to validate identity information presented in profiles donath  boyd 2004 in listing user motivations for friending boyd 2006 points out that friends on snss are “not the same as ‘friends’ in the everyday sense instead friends provide context by offering users an imagined audience to guide behavioral norms” 113 social networking in context of cyber security within social media research another problem domain is the cyber security concerns social media use has been appropriated in industry espionage spying and social media dos and don’ts for guerrilla marketing in the internet age2015 albrecht 2011 algarni xu  chan 2015 alge  braun  esswein 2013 braun  esswein 2016 gaff 2014 hall 2010 hill 2011a hill 2011b judge 2013 molok ahmad  chang 2011 nuha  molok 2011 salminen  degbey 2015 villarreal 2012 studies have been conducted that investigates identity theft in context of social networking sites “participants in social network sites create selfdescriptive profiles that include their links 8 to other members creating a visible network of connections — the ostensible purpose of these sites is to use this network to make friends dates and business connections” donath  boyd 2004 p71 consider a case of social climber who can build an impressive résumé by namedropping of famous people as his friends benefiting from the fact that the listener is unable to verify the authenticity these connections displayed publicly in social networking sites indicate signals that represent attributes or qualities for e g a person who uploads images that displays music studios in back ground and has other famous musicians in the picture along with him signals that probably he belongs to the music industry because “ public display of connection implies verification of identity and can be viewed as a signal of the reliability of one’s identity claims donath  boyd 2004 p 73 public display of connections can also help someone else establish that they are you too” donath  boyd 2004 p 76 participants in social networks make their personal social world information publicly available which can be appropriated in social engineering attacks by the perpetrators or used by the perpetrators for identity theft the rapid growth of social networking sites sns like facebook or linkedin has a dramatic effect on identity theft for two main reasons aïmeur and schőnfeld 2011 studied identity theft in the context of the facebook their work reported that since facebook has the largest database that contains qualitative as well as quantitative data on its users’ personal information perpetrators have found it to be lucrative for conducting identity theft attacks in 2010 the database of facebook was compromised and it was discovered that 15 million accounts along with their associated data was available on sale at all time low price of 45 usd per 1000 contacts idefense 15 million facebook accounts for sale 2010 also once the user uploads the information in facebook the 9 user loses all control over that information there has been ambiguity in the transparency relate to the protection of the privacy of its users and the ownership of the uploaded content on the facebook another security concern faced my most social networking sites is its registration mechanism snss do not validate the users’ identity with any authentication mechanism eg using driving license or ssn to validate if the user is whom the user says is since anybody can create a profile by any name upload any content to that profile this can lead to direct identity theft “anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages” aïmeur  schőnfeld 2011 p 26 hackers can hack in to legitimate facebook accounts and collect personal information not only about the user but also collect information about the users friends and their friends a second major threat of sns concerns the registration process actually sns do not check the identity of the users and anyone can assume any name without control these procedures could lead directly to identity theft with dire consequences for the reputation of the real persons anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages the theft of legitimate accounts is also easy in sns and the hackers use the information contained in the profile itself to take possession of it a last point about sns is to know in which measure we can trust these systems for the protection of data most of these sites are actually free of charge for the users and their only source of income is derived from targeted advertising the resale or the right of access to personal data for advertisers constitutes an enormous information security breach 10 114 social networking in context of information science borko 1968 defines information science is as “that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information the forces that governs the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability” borko further says that information science is related to mathematics logic linguistics psychology computer technology operations research the graphic arts communications library science management and other similar fields and consists of a pure science component which inquires in to the subject without regards to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products 1968 boyd and ellison defines social network sites sns as webbased services that allow individuals to 1 construct a public or semipublic profile within a bounded system 2 articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and 3 view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system 2007 from the above two definitions we see that sns are web based services a component included in the borko’s definition allowing exchange of information as individuals construct profiles and articulate list of other users with whom they establish connections to share their profiles messages pictures in short information wilson 2000 in his work “human information behavior” provides the definition of information seeking behavior information seeking behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal in the course of seeking the individual may interact with manual information systems such as a newspaper or a library or with computerbased systems such as the world wide web wilson 2000 p 49 11 ashgar 2015 recognized the popularity of facebook as a source of information and his work resulted in the development of 23item scale of information seeking in facebook isfs that looked at information seeking behavior and other motives such as socialization entertainment selfseeking diversion in facebook usage the study involved administering the scale to 150 facebook users and analysis of the data showed strong reliability of cronbach’s alpha as 089 the study used several selfreport measures such as general social media usage online friendships facebook friendships and social media use integration to obtain a strong construct validity validity and reliability support suggests that isfs information seeking in facebook scale can be used to measure information seeking behavior on social networking sites like facebook asghar 2015 this research has identified a research gap it was shown by junco 2012 that information seeking in facebook is associated with student engagement or performance indicating that collecting and sharing information through facebook was a positive predictor of academic performance gpa junco 2012 while socialization and time spent on facebook were negative predictors of gpa time spent on facebook was only weakly related to the time spent preparing for class asghar 2015 this implies that there must be another process that must be in play that can relate the relationship between facebook use and gpa 115 information science in context of impression management impression management im a term originated by erving goffman 1959 describes a central aspect of role theory how individual actors create maintain defend and often enhance their social identities through assumptions settings props and scripts 12 in a play metaphor dillard et al 2000 goffman 1959 and schlenker 1980 im explains the motivations behind complex human interactions and performances in the age of information use and control of information plays a pivotal role in our day to day routine impression management controls and regulates the information that people manipulate in order to influence the impressions they form on other people it’s an activity driven by goals shlenker 1980 says that people try to manage impressions of a “person eg self friends enemies object eg a business organization a gift a consumer product event eg a transgression a task performance or idea eg prolife versus prochoice policies capitalism versus socialism through a processes of impression management” schlenker 1980 when people try to manage impressions on others about themselves the process is termed as selfpresentation the origins of impression management can be traced back to erving goffman 1959 where he uses the metaphor of “world stage” to describe role theory where every person is an actor and will act their part through social complex interactions and social identities im is the goaldirected attempt to influence others’ perceptions about a person a group andor an organization regarding an object or event by providing selfassessed beneficial information in social interactions the goal for the aforementioned attempt is to gain an advantageous first impression the motive for this goal is based on the assumption that the target audience’s impressions about the individuals groups or organizations become reality of the target audience goffman 1959 leary  kowalski 1990 on the im “stage” the target audience can be either real or imaginary the impression exists in the subliminal level through socialization and generally does not manifest until the “actor” either succeeds or fails to resonate with the target “audience” and in turn the 13 targeted “audience” transforms the performance of the “actor” into the reality of the target “audience” figure 11goffman’s impression management model one of the prime concepts in impression management is role constraints social roles carry expectations regarding how individuals who occupy those roles are to behave sarbin  allen 1968 the failure to convey impressions consistent with ones role not only diminishes ones effectiveness in that role but also in many cases can lead the individual to lose the right to enact that role goffman 1959 conveying impressions is effectively the communication process requiring that the process needs both sending and receiving of information linking role constraints to the study under information science goffman 1959 provided an insightful analysis of the “role governed nature of selfpresentation” his observations included the analysis of how people behave when they are not in front of their target audience goffman notes that in ‘back stage’ ie when the target audience is absent the actor individuals will come out of their role governed acting the actor will relax behaviors will be more ‘regressed’ involving informal dialects or lingo using openly sexual remarks and a kidding attitude 1959 p 112 goffman went on to raise the interesting question of whether a backstage gives individuals an opportunity to regress or whether regression inappropriate occasions that are not socially 14 accepted brings out the ‘regressed’ or back stage behavior 1959 p 128 studying user behavior is a domain under the specialty of user theory which is one of the main sub disciplines in information science white  mccain 1998 p 337 impression management finally refers to current or potential social image finally the impressions people try to create are affected both by how they think they are currently regarded by others and by how they think others may perceive them in the future on the basis of future revelations about them for example public failures and embarrassing events compel people to engage in impressionable strategies designed to counter or repair the damaged image goffman 1955 information science also includes analytical study of learned literatures and their social contexts white  mccain 1998 p 337 wilson 2000 describes the intedisciplinarity of information science discipline information science is not the only discipline to be concerned with the user and use of information mention has been made earlier of the role of the user requirements phase in the design of computerbased systems but other disciplines also have an interest from different perspectives for example psychological studies of personality have dealt with information processing and cognition wilson 2000 p 52 the above research informs the audience on the connectedness between information science and impression management 116 information science and cyber security 1161 fuzzy logic information science and cyber security uncertainty is one of the basic facets of human cognition the concept of a generalized constraint and its fundamental premise is that information may be viewed as a generalized constraint the generalized theory of uncertainty proposed by zadeh 2005 increases our understanding of the foundations of information and uncertainty 15 “uncertainty is linked to information through the concept of granular structure––a concept which plays a key role in human interaction with the real world” higashi  klir 1982 zadeh 1979 granulation is inescapable in human cognition the concept of defining linguistic variables where possible values for the variable ‘age’ could be young middleaged and old entwines with the concept of granularity zedeh 1973 connection between granulation of attribute and the use of linguistic variable can be explained by the fact that cognitive capabilities of human sensory organs and brain have limited ability to store information “for example looking at monika i see that she is young but cannot pinpoint her age as a single number zadeh 2005 p 3 the concept of a linguistic variable plays a pivotal role in almost all applications of fuzzy logic dubois prade  yager 1997 yager  filev 1994 the above research informs the connection between information science and fuzzy networks research has progressed on how data is processed at the remote terminal unit level using fuzzy logic and fuzzygenetic algorithms kumar chandna  thomas 2003 preprocessed data integral to the development of automation substations p 1582 revolutionizing automation scenario in power systems thomas kumar  chandna 2004 is foundational to supervisory control and data acquisition scada networks patel bhatt and graham 2009 report that utility and infrastructure companies use scada networks for managing public transportation in a given metropolitan area typically comprising buses subways and elevated trains as well as in transportation of raw materials for manufacturing of electricity oil gas and various other commodities patel bhatt  graham 2009 scada networks allow many devices to be operated remotely such as track switches traffic signals electric circuit breakers valves relays sensors and water and gas pumps many of these networks that were 16 already implemented in infrastructures were developed with little or no consideration towards security and they thus have become susceptible to being easy targets of attacks by terrorist groups kumar et al further reports that scada network are extremely popular in the field of industrial production due to its natural propinquity for its use of internet and wireless technologies allowing automatic monitoring of remote facilities “modern scada networks integrated with corporate networks and the internet have become far more vulnerable to unauthorized cyberattacks” patel et al 2009 p 131 1162 security as a function of information asymmetries in a nobel prize winning work economist george akerlof in 1984 discuss markets with asymmetric information “akerlof showed informational asymmetries could produce adverse selection in market asymmetric information is a common feature of market interactions” as cited in lofgren persson  weibull 2002 p 196 with respect to quality of the products seller often is better informed than the buyer in case of security products security product vendor’s projects often try to market the capabilities of their products software security returns on investment are often intangible “roi is the present value of accumulated net benefits over a certain time period divided by the initial costs of investments” jermanblažič 2008 p 418 in case of information security cost can easily be computed as it is the cost of the information security products and the cost of operations benefits of implementing security measures are intangible “it is very difficult to define assess or measure the benefits firewalls ids antivirus software and other security solutions do not generate revenue that can be measured” jermanblažič 2008 p 418 prior research indicates “the benefits resulting from information security 17 investment are measured as cost savings that result from preventing information security breaches gordon  loeb 2006 the vendors know that the buyers will not be able to assess the benefits and often get away with quoting high prices for the security products since buyers are not able to trust the vendor’s claims buyers are disinclined in high investments in security measures vendors are thus disinclined to invest in development of high quality security products anderson  moore 2006 the seller of a good often knows more about its quality than the prospective buyer the job applicant typically knows more about his ability than his potential employer lofgren persson  weibull 2002 because buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for quality they cannot measure buyers often determines the prices they are willing to pay at those prices sellers are only able to offer low quality products the software market suffers from the same information asymmetry when personal information will be used in privacy decisionmaking and how it would be used is knowledge only amongst subset of the decision makers leads to privacy violations caused by asymmetric information incomplete information affects privacy decisions acquisti  grossklags 2005 p 27 privacy breaches can occur when people benefits from transactions using a third person’s personal information without that person being a part of that transaction varian 1997 asymmetrical information also occurs since benefits occurring from taking privacy protecting measures cannot be measured ‘deterministic’ and uncertain since benefits may be stochastic and rely on other new arbitrary distributions acquisti  grossklags 2005 p 27 acquisti further say that people have tendency to take decisions that favor immediate gratifications even if they know that the decision may be hurt them in the long run an example of this would be a student on 18 limited income deciding to install a free antivirus software with limited capabilities benefits associated with protection against privacy intrusion are often recognized only after the privacy violations have taken place if the damage involves financial loss which can be quantified it becomes easy to see the benefits that could have prevented the damage by implementing protection measures but often these benefits are more complex multifaceted and are context specific this research informs the audience the connection between security as a function of information that makes it an area of investigation under the discipline of information sciences 12 introduction to the problem statement 121 positive online leads to positive offline behavior research and practice indicate that computer users including internet users generally mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior yee bailenson  ducheneaut 2009 in fact this robust onlineoffline relationship is a fundamental tenet of computer training which anticipates that online training of positive concepts and activities should reinforce positive offline beliefs and performance eastmond 1995a matthews 1999 moore  kearsley 2011 robst 2007 vrasidas 2000 surprisingly relatively little research has focused on the relationship between negative online and negative offline behaviors 122 negative online leads to negative offline behavior training reinforces many behaviors konijn 2000 but it is the training context that determines whether the reinforcement effects are positive or negative negative 19 behaviors are those that can have an adverse effect on the wellbeing and performance of those who were the target burnes  pope 2007 this research focuses on the dark side of the training relationship suggesting that online training of negative concepts and activities should likewise reinforce negative offline beliefs and performance negative behaviors are those that border on incivility aggression violence pearson andersson  wegner 2001 impetuous behavior is defined as behavior with negative connotation which is characterized with people acting on a sudden idea without considering the results of their actions “urban dictionary impetuous” 2016 it also means reckless or irresponsible behavior meltzer 2005 this study also considers impetuous behaviors to include risqué behaviors that are sexuallysuggestive behaviors which can border on being uncivil sexual harassment rude insensitive sexual advances and disrespectful p brown  levinson 1987 table 11 type of behaviors behaviors online

offline environment mckenna  green 2002 it is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior neal et al 2006 therefore research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highlyundesirable offline behavior and even tragic results “jessica logan” 2015 “ryan halligan the story” 2015 “the tragic megan meier story” 2015 “the tragic story of tyler clementi” 2015 thus this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems 124 the problem of inadequate parental internet supervision and control inadequate parental supervision and control of children’s online behavior morrongiello kane  zdzieborski 2011 morrongiello read et al 2011 contributes to negative offline behavior previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children morrongiello kane et al 2011 this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior newcomb  loeb 1999 substance use violent behavior early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults are some of the negative behaviors beets et al 2009 bullying others at workplace burnes  pope 2007 is extension of negative aggressive behaviors other negative behaviors include truancy bullying 21 insubordination disrespect tardiness fighting stealing and vandalism p brown  levinson 1987 another factor that influences the onset of problematic online behavior in young internet users is largely attributable to inadequate parental supervision and control over their offspring morrongiello kane  zdzieborski 2011 morrongiello read et al 2011 previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children morrongiello kane et al 2011 this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior newcomb  loeb 1999 games and simulation overlap aircraft simulators math games spelling games are designed to help students so that the act of repeating a behavior or skill set effects in enhancing grasping learning a talent set or a conduct ericsson krampe  teschrömer 1993 previous research indicates that games provide effective motivational learning environments trevino et al 2016 and can be designed to target specific contents of the subject matter randel morris  wetzel 1992 simulation techniques are helpful to train the students achieve accuracy in low frequency events such as emergency landing procedures and processes that have irreversible outputs such as surgical procedures damassa  sitko 2010 parenting behavior is bidimensional support conduct that characterizes parental attitude towards their children hoeve et al 2009 positive support occurs when children experience parental warmth acceptance approval and responsiveness to their needs maccoby  martin 1983 rohner 2004 similarly negative support occurs when 22 children experience parental hostility insensitivity lack of communication and intimacy neglect and rejection  hoeve et al 2009 holden 1997 maccoby  martin 1983 rohner 2004 rollins  thomas 1979 at home parents today are providing less childrearing guidance for their children than their own parents provided them baumrind 1971 zervides 2007 this is evident in the findings of study conducted by zervide and knoles 2007 which shows that there has been a trend of changes of parental rearing styles from authoritarian to authoritative to more lenient and democratic styles zervides 2007 prior research has indicated those young teenagers who regard ‘parental rearing behaviors’ as being over meddling disciplinary and lacking in approachability has led to the problematic use of the internet in the youth suggesting that the influences of parenting style and family function are important factors in the development of internet dependency mengchen  med 2010 previous research in context to the children sustaining injuries show that many children today have access to private bedrooms jiow  lim 2012 olson et al 2007 often spent considerable amount of their awake time unsupervised and unmonitored and that lessened control is often linked with increased children’s risky behaviors harrell 2003 morrongiello corbett mccourt  johnston 2006 morrongiello kane et al 2011 such children are also likely to have access to such genres of video games that are most likely to be violent and matured content jiow  lim 2012 olson et al 2007 the reasons for this could be that parents face many challenges in monitoring and supervising children because todays contemporary parents have to juggle their personal professional life often facing adversity in face of magnifying ‘socialisolation’ and their various social professional and family commitments “parenting today” nd these 23 challenges include limitations affecting their ability to continuously monitor children playing together or alone both which include playing video games livingstone 2007 livingstone  helsper 2008 nikken  jansz 2006 for example single parents or those who are timeconstrained are more likely to allow video and computer games to “baby sit” their children—keeping them engaged indoors and occupied—but unsupervised cauchon 2005 harms  clifford 1989 wilsondoenges 2001 worley 2011 such timeconstrained parents have selfreported that they lack time and technical expertise to understand video games and are more than likely to stop monitoring and supervision over period of time as they perceive their children to possess superior technical expertise to their own oosting ijsselsteijn  kort 2008 parents have also rationalized their indifference toward inappropriate content in video games because they believe that their children are unaffected by these games “violent video games and young people” 2008 according to pro cons videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and

supervision and monitoring not only at home but they may also face similar circumstances at schools where lack of supervision monitoring and guidance would impact children to behave risqué in school environment in preinternet society parents exercised a more dominant role in raising their children and instilling values comer 1993 gillies 2008 grusec 2002 but in contemporary society with many parents working as parents provide less guidance for their children at home research indicates that more parents throughout the world harbor an expectation that schools assume that dominant role—in teaching supervising and mentoring children’s’ behavior dinham  scott 2000 at school parents today expect more childrearing guidance be provided for their children than their schools provided them grolnick friendly  bellas 2009 steinberg lamborn dornbusch  darling 25 1992 usher  kober 2012 zervides 2007 parents thus harbor expectations from the schools to provide the necessary supervision to their children although parents still want their children to mature into responsible citizens in the contemporary societies parents expect the school authorities to assume most of the responsibility towards this goal expecting the schools to do most of the work associated with imparting knowledge as well as values comer 1993 delattre  delattre 2005 however parents are reluctant to allow schools to take disciplinary actions against their children barge  loges 2003 ferrara  ferrar 2005 georgiou 2008 as a result of this school children are often likely to receive little or no discipline what so ever ferrara  ferrar 2005 school environments thus are often less effective in fulfilling the expectation of contemporary parents in the area of being able to teach basic values to their children and thus are ineffective in fulfilling the expectation of the society in large edmonds 1979 mcevoy  welker 2000 olweus 1994 lack of disciplinary actions from school authorities can lead to increase in disruptive behaviors in school nelson martella  galand 1998 studies also have indicated students have engaged in menacing actions including stalking bullying physical or verbal assaults and “hijacking” classrooms kuhlenschmidt  layne 1999 schneider 1998 which makes understanding this behavior important in context to our research overall sociologists and legal authorities indicate that contemporary children receive less than adequate disciplinary guidance or supervision at home or at school ferrara  ferrar 2005 pang 2009 there is yet another dimension to the disruptive behaviors of the children that is seen in public situations less than adequate child rearing guidance at home and school is likely to influence children’s behavior in the society that can impact the citizens of the 26 society at large ferrara  ferrar 2005 pang 2009 kelly  2007 reported in new york times an issue that exemplified disruptive and unruly behavior in a public library in new jersey community kelly 2007 every afternoon at maplewood middle school’s final bell dozens of students pour across baker street to the public library some study quietly others library officials say fight urinate on the bathroom floor scrawl graffiti on the walls talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked one recently threatened to burn down the branch library librarians call the police sometimes twice a day kelly 2007 another example is acquisition of certain behavior traits which are deemed necessary for survival on the streets and characterizes greater approval of the use of violence more pronounced aggression use of rough language and tendency to ridicule parental and school authority which is popularly known as street corner sub culture chilman 1965 crain  weisman 1972 hanna 1988 child in need of services chins enacted in multiple states in the us is defined by law as a child that is consistently absent from school consistently disobey reasonable directions of his or her parents and teachers is fugitive wanders or loiters about the streets highway or any public place and does something wrong wolf  larrick 2012such a child is believed to be beyond the control of the parental guidance and direction and such behavior endangers the health safety and welfare of the child wolf  larrick 2012 undiagnosed adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also lead to children behaving in such a way that could be constituted as disruptive hallowell nd studies thus indicates that such children whose disruptive behavioral traits at large go unchecked by the guiding influences in their lives are likely to developing learning 27 difficulties school problems peer relationship difficulties criminality and more severe and longlasting mental disorders joachim sanders  turner 2010 125 uninhibited online behavior another concern that is important from the context of this study is the uninhibited online behavior that may have implications on people’s offline behavior research indicates that especially with teenagers online behavior typically is less inhibited and restrained than offline behavior uninhibited online behavior lead from online risqué behavior to offline risky behavior in impressionable young students joseph m kayany 1998 online smart phone dating applications like tinder grindr growlr scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers woo 2015 thus online risqué behavior is translated in to offline risky behavior teenagers often exhibit uninhibited online behavior which is referred to as ‘flaming behavior’ and is defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility such as swearing calling names ridiculing and hurling insults towards another person hisher character religion race intelligence and physical or mental ability”joseph m kayany 1998 reasons are that these activities are frequently 1 invisible as with monitoring by parents or law enforcement cauchon 2005 harms  clifford 1989 wilsondoenges 2001 worley

chaikin 1975 uninhibited online behavior can lead to online risqué behavior that can lead to offline risky behavior for example internet addiction disorder that can lead to obsessivecompulsive use of the internet can influence transitioning of online risqué behavior to offline risky behavior in impressionable young students 126 desirable and undesirable outcomes resulting from online behavior students using excessive internet can have desirable effects that can include information seeking cognitive training resulting in individuals becoming independent as well as allowing advancement of career and social connections desirable outcomes of second nature and formation of automatic behavior from practice and drill use of the internet can be associated with the outcomes that assist offline cognitive decision making and physical performance including distance education from grade school to post graduate levels professional training and behavioral modification eastmond 1995a 1995b

formal relationship such as class team projects or competing for high grades or coveted membership to an academic or social club would result in disconnectedness amongst themselves in otherwise social setting over period of time this social disconnectedness leads to the feeling of powerlessness that can lead to excessive use of the internet generating apathy amongst students sashittal et al 2012

conducted on impetuous impression management or 34 the reasons for teenager and young adults for impetuous risqué impression projection in an online environment and more specifically in facebook this research therefore proposes to study the factors that influences people impetuous image projection on facebook the purpose of this research is to fill the identified research gap sidorova et al 2008 identified how information technology it systems are developed and how individuals groups organizations and markets interact with it sidorova evangelopoulos valacich  ramakrishnan 2008 therefore research on facebook corresponds to one of the core research areas of it systems as identified by sidorova et al 2008 namely how groups interact with it sidorova et al 2008 as a group ware technology that relies on the interaction between their users facebook has generated tremendous value due to its vast expansion of its usergenerated network xu ryan prybutok  wen 2012 for example a study that

in psychology and cyber psychology has looked at issues related to anonymity catharsis and autonomy related to unrestrained behavior in offline environment christopherson 2007 derlega  chaikin 1975 not much study has been conducted on impetuous behaviors and the effect of the impression management on facebook because impetuous online leads to potentially dangerous offline suggestive behavior benotsch snipes martin  bull 2013 which can result in tragic consequences “jessica logan” 2015 “ryan halligan the story” 2015 “the tragic megan meier story” 2015 “the tragic story of tyler clementi” 2015 this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems the above discussion informs that impetuous risqué behavior generally falls into the undesirable outcomes of online activities of the users of facebook 131 impetuous and risky behaviors this research considers two kinds of behavior impetuous and risky in both online and offline environments however this study focuses on impetuous behavior an example of impetuous behavior is the risqué behavior which is “slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being sexually suggestive” “oxford dictionaries risque” 2016 common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann 2011 roberts 2012 36 risky behavior encompasses the possibility of danger failure or loss “oxford dictionaries risky” 2016 as such both behaviors exist in online and offline environments with overlapping but often distinct consequences benotsch et al 2013 132 impetuous onlineoffline versus risky onlineoffline behaviors impetuous and risky online behaviors contribute to negative risqué and risky offline behaviors this research therefore defines impetuous online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment eg sexting lohmann 2011 flaming kayany 1998 similarly in this study impetuous offline behavior is defined as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior that includes being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment wilson  brazendale 1973 substance use violent behavior early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults beets et al 2009 truancy bullying insubordination disrespect tardiness fighting stealing and vandalism brown  levinson 1987 risky online behavior is behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude cyber security breaches landwehr et al 2012 and online espionage flusche 2001 schneier 2014 are instances of risky online behavior risky offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude eg social engineering luo brody seazzu  burd 2013 competitive car 37 racing that can result in accidents gullone moore moss  boyd 2000 high risk sexual behavior benotsch et al 2013 are instances of potentially dangerous offline behaviors 133 impetuous online leading to potentially dangerous offline results another study found that excessive amounts of “sexting” was robustly linked with “substance use and highrisk sexual behavior including having multiple sexual partners unprotected sex and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections” benotsch et al 2013 online smart phone dating applications like tinder grindr growlr scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqué sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers woo 2015 impetuous behavior can be hazardous to this population for two reasons 1 younger users invest a lot of time in the internet particularly in its social features burnay billieux blairy  laroi 2015 laconi tricard  chabrol 2015 lu  yeo 2015 and 2 a significant number these younger users engage in risqué online behaviors ie behaviors that are considered undesirable provocative andor highrisk in current society black stone  johnson 2015 peluchette  karl 2010 shah 2010 wahdan nimr kotb  wahdan 2014 a concern of this research is that 1 and 2 can cyclically reinforce and feed each other yielding accumulating undesirable results for individuals and for society this research seeks to break this cycle and to prevent its recurrence 134 suggestive risqué or negative online behavior risqué is behavior that “slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being 38 sexually suggestive”“oxford dictionaries” nd common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann 2011 roberts 2012 “what is ‘sexting’ nude or risque pics sent by teens expose them to serious legal and social consequences” 2009 this research therefore defines risqué online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment it is mostly indecent as in sexting flirting and scandalous behavior as in posting provocative images in an online environment  risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy “definition of risqué” nd example risqué behavior includes ‘flaming behavior’ which has been defined as “uninhibited behavior in computer mediated communication” or “flaming” as “an uninhibited expression of hostility such as swearing calling names ridiculing and hurling insults towards another person hisher character religion race intelligence and physical or mental ability kayany 1998 1341 suggestive risqué offline behavior this study defines suggestive risqué offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment this type of behavior has been extensively described in popular as well as academic literatures wilson and brazendale 1973 conducted a study where they described appropriation of suggestive offline behavior by conducting an experiment that involved 39 using what they described as risqué slides of seaside postcards based largely on sexual innuendo to administer a humor test g d wilson  brazendale 1973 recently the wall street journal reported another instance of suggestive risqué offline behavior it has been brought to our attention by building management and security that the stairwells are being used inappropriately cigarettes plastic cups filled with beer and several used condoms were found in the stairwell yes you read that right do not use the stairwells to smoke drink eat or have sex please respect building and company policy and use common sense winkler r 2016 another instance of offline suggestive behavior includes demeaning derogatory sexually suggestive behavior towards teachers in classroom oluwole 2015 1342 dangerous risky online behavior oxford dictionary defines risky as “full of the possibility of danger failure or loss”“oxford dictionaries risky” nd this research defines ‘dangerous risky online behavior’ as behavior that is exhibited via digital medium or the internet that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible failure or loss of some tangible magnitude for example risks associated with online trading has been discussed in details in academic literature fan  chen 2005 looney akbulut  poston 2008 risks associated with online gambling has also been discussed extensively in academic literature fishburn  kochenberger 1979 krueger  dickson 1994 1343 dangerous risky offline behavior this research defines dangerous risky offline behavior as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment that can have dangerous outcomes that can lead to possible 40 failure or loss of some tangible magnitude risky behavior is indecent  and scandalous behavior meeting people for casual sexual encounters having relationships outside matrimony in an offline environment  it is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy high risk sexual behaviors have been discussed extensively in academic literature d’arcy  devaraj 2012 vakharia 2013 risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare and involving acts of substance use risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence street fights and bar fights ie any act that is antisocial 1344 risqué impression behavior this research defines risqué behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment it is mostly indecent as in sexting flirting and scandalous behavior as in posting provocative images in an online environment risqué is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and

indecent and scandalous behavior it is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy “definition of risqué” nd popular media have acknowledged and discussed facebook users risqué content posted on facebook for instance popular media word of mouth and social media marketing reported the ‘computer babies post’ posted by intel which can be categorized as risqué content that went viral immediately indicating that users post risqué content to their facebook profile which allows them instant popularity h morris 2012 other popular media have discussed whether risqué content should be allowed or not on facebook brown 2013 “facebook’s ‘porn cops’” 2010 shapira nd however there is not much empirical study conducted on this wide observed behavior pattern of facebook users impression management thus assumes central position in this research because this work emphasizes the importance of shaping teenager personalities to become welladapted and productive citizens in future technological society impression management has been extensively researched in sociology and psychology disciplines 42 krämer  winter 2008 the framework has been applied in various practical applications as public relations piwinger  ebert 2001 forensic literature perri  lichtenwald 2010 in the area of sports and psychology ginis lindwall  prapavessis

showed that there are factors that influence the relationship between video games and increased violence video games that harness the violenceappeal are built on instant gratification there is an instant reward or penalty for carrying out the violent act in a game for instance a ‘kill‘ segment will instantly gain the user with a jackpot reward or allow the user to continue to the next level here the gamer identifies with the character in the game in first person these emblematic aggressions impact the psychology of the player as the player controls the character of the game and therefore the player experiences the act of aggression as seen through the eyes of the character in the game dill  dill 1999 understanding the impact of video games on student’s psyche is also important from the is discipline perspective 1351 how is gaming relevant to information systems gaming is in many ways relevant to is and this study because this work recognizes a convergence of is user and gaming user requirements entertainment software association esa reported that of 155 million americans that played videogames 26 43 of the gamers are less than 18 years of age and an average of 65 hrs per

that such parents almost do not check the ratings of the videogames that are purchased by the children carnagey  anderson 2004 according to procons videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres “charts graphs on video games youth violence” 2015 further research indicates that violent video games desensitize children at an early age to the effects of violence carnagey anderson  bushman 2007 research also indicates that it is possible for undeveloped minds of the children to get heavily influenced by these violent themes gunter 1998 research further indicates this influence induced by the content of the violence in the games can lead to acts of violence and aggression sherry 2001thus some of the impacts when parents do not supervise their children’s offline behavior includes increased violent and aggressive behavior increased highrisk behaviors including alcohol and tobacco use

users ractham et al 2012 which constitutes one of the core research area of is vessey et al 2002 in this study we have concentrated on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by studying how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online risqué behavior of students on social networking sites and in this way our paper represents a mainstream area of

facebook research wilson et al 2012 studied and identified 412 peer reviewed research articles on facebook literature this work categorizes this previous research into six distinct themes 1 the

management to is vessey et al 2002 lists the topics that are studies under is research vessey et al 2002 some of those topics include systemssoftware management concepts project management risk management personnel issues problems domain specific concepts information systems including group support systems organizational concepts strategies cultural implications societal concepts cultural implications ethical implications vessey et al 2002 these topics can be linked to the topics studied under impression management im leary and kowalski 1990 describe im to have consisted of topics such as goal relevance of impressions value of desired goals discrepancy between desired and current image impression construction construct of self desired and undesired identity images role constraints targets value and current or potential image it is concluded that impression management covers a wide spectrum of core research areas in information systems impression management can thus be seen to have a direct relevance to is research 137 groupware technology when technologies are designed in such a way that they serve the purpose of facilitating human interactions with the system rather than systems being used to solve some problems they are called groupware systems “groupware is defined as computer based systems that supports groups of people engaged in a common task or goals and 53 that provide an interface to a shared environment” ellis gibbs  rein 1991 christopherson 2007 studied influences of anonymity in computermediated communication cmc and sia etal 2002 study that looked at group polarization using groupware conferencing apparatus that utilized text based communications indicates that facebook is groupware technology 14 problem statement the usage of sns and the computer mediated communication media has been appropriated beyond its intended use this study concentrates on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by exploring how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online behavior of students on social networking sites and in this way our paper represents a mainstream area of information science is research and contributes to the development of the discipline this study attempts to study the impression motivation which is the awareness that facebook is being used for uses other than the intended uses on the image construction which is the behavior exhibited through their online profile images the current research proposes to investigate balancing of the tradeoff between perceived privacy concerns and an active social media presence the proposed generalized research question of this dissertation is “do active social media presence and various privacy concerns have any influence on student’s online behaviors on social media” this research will investigate this question in three different studies as following essay 1 investigates impression management theory as applied to social networking the growth of social networking sites in the last few years has changed the 54 pattern of its utility thereby providing yet another new social phenomenon essay 1 focus on the business implications by investigating the intention of recruiting managers to use social networking sites like facebook and myspace to conduct checks on prospective job candidates also school authorities and law enforcement have occasionally used facebook evidence for taking actions because they have been able to confirm or trace of criminal activities using the framework of impression management theory this study examines how online behavior of students is related to visibility awareness social networking site information trust and awareness of various features of technology essay 1 thus examines if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as visibility awareness and privacy concerns which is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave responsibly which is operationalized as responsible image on social media in essay 2 i extend essay 1 and fill in the research gap to investigate the negative impression management of students on facebook i focus on the risks associated with negative or risqué online behavior of students that can get mimicked to risky offline behaviors often leading to tragic results using the framework of impression management theory i examine how negative online behavior of students is related to students portraying different personalities by selectively disclosing their personas aided by awareness of various privacy features of technology essay 2 thus explores if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as selective disclosure and desired differential personas and privacy concerns that is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave negatively which is operationalized as negative or risqué image on social media 55 in essay 3 i extend the conceptual framework of essay 1 and look at trust and privacy of social networking while investigating factors influencing student behavior on facebook in the context of impression management with this study i aim to extend the previous studies by using the framework of trust in digital information to investigate privacy and security concerns related to the use of social networking this essay is still a work in progress and i am in the process of analyzing data essay 3 researches if factors such as dimensions of active social media presence such as impression motivation and information trustworthiness and privacy concerns operationalized as technology awareness influences students to have distinct impression management operationalized as image construction on social media my investigation shows that the impression management framework serves as the most important base model for predictors of social networking behaviors to increase the awareness of information and cyber security in order to promote the best security practices each essay has been built by reviewing the existing literature in social networking cyber security and information systems theories to increase the awareness of privacy and security concerns related with problematic use of the internet the research and the frameworks posited allow us to identify relevant concerns and directions for further research my work posits and supports new theory development and shows the overarching importance of researching privacy and security in social network analysis as a major organizational construct 15 research design the rest of this study is organized as below the next section describes 56 generalized literature review that discusses the periphery of the problem area the three research essays follow this each research essay is organized with its own introduction literature review statement of hypotheses research model methodology proposed instruments data analysis discussion and implications and limitations,1 chapter 1 introduction and problem statement 11 subject area 111 importance of social media research webbased social networking is in a general sense

social media strategy today s leaders must embrace social media for three reasons first they provide a lowcost platform on which to build your personal brand communicating who you are both within and outside your company second they allow you to engage rapidly and simultaneously with peers employees customers and the broader public especially younger generations in the same transparent and direct way they expect from everyone in their lives third they give you an opportunity to learn from instant information and unvarnished feedback dutta 2010 p 2 research in social media includes investigating activities of its users and the level of those investigations aral et al 2013 classifies areas of activities in to four broad 2 categories namely design and features strategy and tactics management organization and measurement value at three levels namely consumers and society platforms and intermediaries and firms and industries aral et al 2013 p 4 i am addressing the problem domain that broadly considers intersection of design features of social media analyzed at the level of and platforms and intermediaries research associated with design and features includes investigating the appropriation of features of social networking by different stakeholders such as individuals in social context and individuals in context of business users this category depicts how patrons companies and governments use explicit social media features and how these technologies are made available to the users at the same time design research also considers how constrains can be enforced to prevent misappropriation of the same features thus design looks in to standardizing and regulating the various facets of social media development and implementation individuals businesses or governments are the users of social media which constitutes platforms and intermediaries that continuously innovate and grow using the platform of social media such as twitter facebook etc aral et al 2013 have listed some of the research agendas which lie in the intersection of my research domain of interest they are how can users optimize their use of social media which objectives do users pursue in using social media how can users create relationships curate information broaden their reach and maximize their influence what are the benefits and risks associated with use of social media what is the nonmonetary value that social media create eg equality health violence civic engagement 3 how do specific features and designs help platforms attract users create engagement enable and constrain user behavior and increase revenue how can platforms maximize their influence and revenue should platforms be open or closed standardized or ad hoc aral et al 2013 process of social interactions is complex and governed by societal norms social media features are designed and developed in such a way that they enforce constraints on the user behavior to conform to the societal norms social media thus exhibit candid impact on the societal framework aral et al 2013 social media is the futuristic phenomenon intricately associated with human behavior and in the emerging era of the internet of things its understanding has become critical for new directions in development of technologies one of the emerging trends of the appropriation of social media includes the talent acquisition process where companies have started appropriating social networks to track talent to match to the open positions aral et al 2013 linkedin is one such example where a service that began as a job portal emerged in to a social media where the jobseekers do not have to pay for registration and create a profile garg and telang 2011 reported that features in linkedin such as connections which can either be further classified as weak or strong serves different purposes weak ties help the individual to come across a job lead while the strong ties and first connection helps an individual to get job interview as well as job offer garg telang 2011 the site slowly developed to include features that encouraged the job seekers to update much more information than just their resume the features of endorsing skills which essentially is a part of social network analysis is appropriated by the employers to gather much more information about the candidate to be able to perform a close fit of the talent to the open positions premium services are created both for the job seekers and the employers 4 hence it is thus seen that many job portals have emerged in to becoming social networking sites the concept being social networking encourages users to upload much more social information in context of the talent acquisition this makes more information available to both the parties the job seekers and the employers on one hand jobseekers gain more information such as average salaries that a position can command best working conditions perks and benefits and so on on the other hand the employers can gather much more information about the candidate apart which gives them the ability to match the right candidate to the right job this kind of appropriation has transformed the job portals into something much more giving the service providers competitive edge w kim jeong lee 2010 schwartz 2013 evolution of social media in this direction gives rise to the considerations that users can use to strategically position themselves on the social media in order to realize their goals pertaining to their career choices research in social media and social networking is still in its embryonic stage and is emerging the above research has introduced my specific area of research interest in the information related phenomenon that is observed in the emergence of social media the above section also leads us to finding out why social networking is an area of interest under the discipline of information sciences 112 social networking in context of impression management social networking sites have been a focus of empirical research and have been studied from the perspective of impression management in various interdisciplinary studies such as psychology sociology computermediated communications etc 5 rosenberg and egbert 2011 studied the utility of personality traits and secondary goals as predictors of selfpresentation tactics employed by facebook users secondary goals are recurring motivations in an individual s life and include identity goals interaction goals personal resource goals and arousal management goals dillard segrin harden 1989 rosenberg and egbert reported that individual personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals and that secondary goals predicted the use of various selfpresentation tactics used on facebook results indicated that these personality traits and secondary goals are both theoretically and empirically sound components for the conceptualization of online impression management rosenberg egbert 2011 this study prompts further research in self presentation on facebook considering the effect of audience segmentation and how individuals deal with problems of multiple audiences having access to their profile and being witnesses to their activity on facebook such as friends versus family members lampe ellison steinfield 2006 lampe ellison steinfield 2007 stutzman 2006 for instance a child may experience uncertainty when parent would want to be added to the child s facebook page the child may not want the parent to view hisor her facebook page i have engaged this theme in my research essay where i investigated factors affecting online behavior of people living with hiv and aids on facebook where one of the construct i have looked at is the selective disclosure in context of stigma faced by people living with hiv allbright 2002 conducted a study to investigate relationship formation over computer mediated communication channels contrary to notion where physical proximity and cues such as eye contact body language etc have been seen as critical to the 6 formation of attraction this study investigates how relationships are formed online without physical proximity and cues a popular belief about online profiles is that people are more likely to construct false profiles with respect to their true age class and even gender using goffmans theory of impression management and literature on deception in communication this study compared the first impression people formed online with the second impression formed offline and the reason for any disparity in the two impressions albright reported that most people were honest with each other online and the majority of participants reported being as or more attracted to their online lovers with increased information via phone calls photos exchanged and face to face meetings most misimpressions in these relationships were the result of respondents filling in the blanks incorrectly or idealization rather than being victims of overt deception albright gives direction for future research in three areas she points out that not much research has been conducted in the areas of projection and idealization secondly she urges the researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate if these relationships are more viable long term than those formed in facetoface contexts and lastly albright recommends that further investigations are needed to assess why some relationships never move out of the online environment to a facetoface meeting albright 2002 using albrights themes one area that i have looked in to is the invisibility issue face by communities of people living with hiv and aids in context of the stigma associated with the disease i have looked at solution space for people having concerns about disclosing their identities to use sns as a platform to be able to meet other people living with hiv with the aim of forming longterm relationships in my research study titled benefits and 7 risks associated with using secret facebook support group for people living with hiv and aids snss constitute an important research context for scholars investigating processes of impression management selfpresentation and friendship performance in one of the earliest academic articles on snss boyd 2004 examined friendster as a locus of publicly articulated social networks that allowed users to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others donath boyd 2004 donath and boyd 2004 extended this to suggest that public displays of connection serve as important identity signals that help people navigate the networked social world in that an extended network may serve to validate identity information presented in profiles donath boyd 2004 in listing user motivations for friending boyd 2006 points out that friends on snss are not the same as friends in the everyday sense instead friends provide context by offering users an imagined audience to guide behavioral norms 113 social networking in context of cyber security within social media research another problem domain is the cyber security concerns social media use has been appropriated in industry espionage spying and social media dos and don ts for guerrilla marketing in the internet age2015 albrecht 2011 algarni xu chan 2015 alge braun esswein 2013 braun esswein 2016 gaff 2014 hall 2010 hill 2011a hill 2011b judge 2013 molok ahmad chang 2011 nuha molok 2011 salminen degbey 2015 villarreal 2012 studies have been conducted that investigates identity theft in context of social networking sites participants in social network sites create selfdescriptive profiles that include their links 8 to other members creating a visible network of connections the ostensible purpose of these sites is to use this network to make friends dates and business connections donath boyd 2004 p71 consider a case of social climber who can build an impressive r sum by namedropping of famous people as his friends benefiting from the fact that the listener is unable to verify the authenticity these connections displayed publicly in social networking sites indicate signals that represent attributes or qualities for e g a person who uploads images that displays music studios in back ground and has other famous musicians in the picture along with him signals that probably he belongs to the music industry because public display of connection implies verification of identity and can be viewed as a signal of the reliability of one s identity claims donath boyd 2004 p 73 public display of connections can also help someone else establish that they are you too donath boyd 2004 p 76 participants in social networks make their personal social world information publicly available which can be appropriated in social engineering attacks by the perpetrators or used by the perpetrators for identity theft the rapid growth of social networking sites sns like facebook or linkedin has a dramatic effect on identity theft for two main reasons a meur and sch nfeld 2011 studied identity theft in the context of the facebook their work reported that since facebook has the largest database that contains qualitative as well as quantitative data on its users personal information perpetrators have found it to be lucrative for conducting identity theft attacks in 2010 the database of facebook was compromised and it was discovered that 15 million accounts along with their associated data was available on sale at all time low price of 45 usd per 1000 contacts idefense 15 million facebook accounts for sale 2010 also once the user uploads the information in facebook the 9 user loses all control over that information there has been ambiguity in the transparency relate to the protection of the privacy of its users and the ownership of the uploaded content on the facebook another security concern faced my most social networking sites is its registration mechanism snss do not validate the users identity with any authentication mechanism eg using driving license or ssn to validate if the user is whom the user says is since anybody can create a profile by any name upload any content to that profile this can lead to direct identity theft anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages a meur sch nfeld 2011 p 26 hackers can hack in to legitimate facebook accounts and collect personal information not only about the user but also collect information about the users friends and their friends a second major threat of sns concerns the registration process actually sns do not check the identity of the users and anyone can assume any name without control these procedures could lead directly to identity theft with dire consequences for the reputation of the real persons anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages the theft of legitimate accounts is also easy in sns and the hackers use the information contained in the profile itself to take possession of it a last point about sns is to know in which measure we can trust these systems for the protection of data most of these sites are actually free of charge for the users and their only source of income is derived from targeted advertising the resale or the right of access to personal data for advertisers constitutes an enormous information security breach 10 114 social networking in context of information science borko 1968 defines information science is as that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information the forces that governs the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability borko further says that information science is related to mathematics logic linguistics psychology computer technology operations research the graphic arts communications library science management and other similar fields and consists of a pure science component which inquires in to the subject without regards to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products 1968 boyd and ellison defines social network sites sns as webbased services that allow individuals to 1 construct a public or semipublic profile within a bounded system 2 articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and 3 view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system 2007 from the above two definitions we see that sns are web based services a component included in the borko s definition allowing exchange of information as individuals construct profiles and articulate list of other users with whom they establish connections to share their profiles messages pictures in short information wilson 2000 in his work human information behavior provides the definition of information seeking behavior information seeking behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal in the course of seeking the individual may interact with manual information systems such as a newspaper or a library or with computerbased systems such as the world wide web wilson 2000 p 49 11 ashgar 2015 recognized the popularity of facebook as a source of information and his work resulted in the development of 23item scale of information seeking in facebook isfs that looked at information seeking behavior and other motives such as socialization entertainment selfseeking diversion in facebook usage the study involved administering the scale to 150 facebook users and analysis of the data showed strong reliability of cronbach s alpha as 089 the study used several selfreport measures such as general social media usage online friendships facebook friendships and social media use integration to obtain a strong construct validity validity and reliability support suggests that isfs information seeking in facebook scale can be used to measure information seeking behavior on social networking sites like facebook asghar 2015 this research has identified a research gap it was shown by junco 2012 that information seeking in facebook is associated with student engagement or performance indicating that collecting and sharing information through facebook was a positive predictor of academic performance gpa junco 2012 while socialization and time spent on facebook were negative predictors of gpa time spent on facebook was only weakly related to the time spent preparing for class asghar 2015 this implies that there must be another process that must be in play that can relate the relationship between facebook use and gpa 115 information science in context of impression management impression management im a term originated by erving goffman 1959 describes a central aspect of role theory how individual actors create maintain defend and often enhance their social identities through assumptions settings props and scripts 12 in a play metaphor dillard et al 2000 goffman 1959 and schlenker 1980 im explains the motivations behind complex human interactions and performances in the age of information use and control of information plays a pivotal role in our day to day routine impression management controls and regulates the information that people manipulate in order to influence the impressions they form on other people it s an activity driven by goals shlenker 1980 says that people try to manage impressions of a person eg self friends enemies object eg a business organization a gift a consumer product event eg a transgression a task performance or idea eg prolife versus prochoice policies capitalism versus socialism through a processes of impression management schlenker 1980 when people try to manage impressions on others about themselves the process is termed as selfpresentation the origins of impression management can be traced back to erving goffman 1959 where he uses the metaphor of world stage to describe role theory where every person is an actor and will act their part through social complex interactions and social identities im is the goaldirected attempt to influence others perceptions about a person a group andor an organization regarding an object or event by providing selfassessed beneficial information in social interactions the goal for the aforementioned attempt is to gain an advantageous first impression the motive for this goal is based on the assumption that the target audience s impressions about the individuals groups or organizations become reality of the target audience goffman 1959 leary kowalski 1990 on the im stage the target audience can be either real or imaginary the impression exists in the subliminal level through socialization and generally does not manifest until the actor either succeeds or fails to resonate with the target audience and in turn the 13 targeted audience transforms the performance of the actor into the reality of the target audience figure 11goffman s impression management model one of the prime concepts in impression management is role constraints social roles carry expectations regarding how individuals who occupy those roles are to behave sarbin allen 1968 the failure to convey impressions consistent with ones role not only diminishes ones effectiveness in that role but also in many cases can lead the individual to lose the right to enact that role goffman 1959 conveying impressions is effectively the communication process requiring that the process needs both sending and receiving of information linking role constraints to the study under information science goffman 1959 provided an insightful analysis of the role governed nature of selfpresentation his observations included the analysis of how people behave when they are not in front of their target audience goffman notes that in back stage ie when the target audience is absent the actor individuals will come out of their role governed acting the actor will relax behaviors will be more regressed involving informal dialects or lingo using openly sexual remarks and a kidding attitude 1959 p 112 goffman went on to raise the interesting question of whether a backstage gives individuals an opportunity to regress or whether regression inappropriate occasions that are not socially 14 accepted brings out the regressed or back stage behavior 1959 p 128 studying user behavior is a domain under the specialty of user theory which is one of the main sub disciplines in information science white mccain 1998 p 337 impression management finally refers to current or potential social image finally the impressions people try to create are affected both by how they think they are currently regarded by others and by how they think others may perceive them in the future on the basis of future revelations about them for example public failures and embarrassing events compel people to engage in impressionable strategies designed to counter or repair the damaged image goffman 1955 information science also includes analytical study of learned literatures and their social contexts white mccain 1998 p 337 wilson 2000 describes the intedisciplinarity of information science discipline information science is not the only discipline to be concerned with the user and use of information mention has been made earlier of the role of the user requirements phase in the design of computerbased systems but other disciplines also have an interest from different perspectives for example psychological studies of personality have dealt with information processing and cognition wilson 2000 p 52 the above research informs the audience on the connectedness between information science and impression management 116 information science and cyber security 1161 fuzzy logic information science and cyber security uncertainty is one of the basic facets of human cognition the concept of a generalized constraint and its fundamental premise is that information may be viewed as a generalized constraint the generalized theory of uncertainty proposed by zadeh 2005 increases our understanding of the foundations of information and uncertainty 15 uncertainty is linked to information through the concept of granular structure a concept which plays a key role in human interaction with the real world higashi klir 1982 zadeh 1979 granulation is inescapable in human cognition the concept of defining linguistic variables where possible values for the variable age could be young middleaged and old entwines with the concept of granularity zedeh 1973 connection between granulation of attribute and the use of linguistic variable can be explained by the fact that cognitive capabilities of human sensory organs and brain have limited ability to store information for example looking at monika i see that she is young but cannot pinpoint her age as a single number zadeh 2005 p 3 the concept of a linguistic variable plays a pivotal role in almost all applications of fuzzy logic dubois prade yager 1997 yager filev 1994 the above research informs the connection between information science and fuzzy networks research has progressed on how data is processed at the remote terminal unit level using fuzzy logic and fuzzygenetic algorithms kumar chandna thomas 2003 preprocessed data integral to the development of automation substations p 1582 revolutionizing automation scenario in power systems thomas kumar chandna 2004 is foundational to supervisory control and data acquisition scada networks patel bhatt and graham 2009 report that utility and infrastructure companies use scada networks for managing public transportation in a given metropolitan area typically comprising buses subways and elevated trains as well as in transportation of raw materials for manufacturing of electricity oil gas and various other commodities patel bhatt graham 2009 scada networks allow many devices to be operated remotely such as track switches traffic signals electric circuit breakers valves relays sensors and water and gas pumps many of these networks that were 16 already implemented in infrastructures were developed with little or no consideration towards security and they thus have become susceptible to being easy targets of attacks by terrorist groups kumar et al further reports that scada network are extremely popular in the field of industrial production due to its natural propinquity for its use of internet and wireless technologies allowing automatic monitoring of remote facilities modern scada networks integrated with corporate networks and the internet have become far more vulnerable to unauthorized cyberattacks patel et al 2009 p 131 1162 security as a function of information asymmetries in a nobel prize winning work economist george akerlof in 1984 discuss markets with asymmetric information akerlof showed informational asymmetries could produce adverse selection in market asymmetric information is a common feature of market interactions as cited in lofgren persson weibull 2002 p 196 with respect to quality of the products seller often is better informed than the buyer in case of security products security product vendor s projects often try to market the capabilities of their products software security returns on investment are often intangible roi is the present value of accumulated net benefits over a certain time period divided by the initial costs of investments jermanbla i 2008 p 418 in case of information security cost can easily be computed as it is the cost of the information security products and the cost of operations benefits of implementing security measures are intangible it is very difficult to define assess or measure the benefits firewalls ids antivirus software and other security solutions do not generate revenue that can be measured jermanbla i 2008 p 418 prior research indicates the benefits resulting from information security 17 investment are measured as cost savings that result from preventing information security breaches gordon loeb 2006 the vendors know that the buyers will not be able to assess the benefits and often get away with quoting high prices for the security products since buyers are not able to trust the vendor s claims buyers are disinclined in high investments in security measures vendors are thus disinclined to invest in development of high quality security products anderson moore 2006 the seller of a good often knows more about its quality than the prospective buyer the job applicant typically knows more about his ability than his potential employer lofgren persson weibull 2002 because buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for quality they cannot measure buyers often determines the prices they are willing to pay at those prices sellers are only able to offer low quality products the software market suffers from the same information asymmetry when personal information will be used in privacy decisionmaking and how it would be used is knowledge only amongst subset of the decision makers leads to privacy violations caused by asymmetric information incomplete information affects privacy decisions acquisti grossklags 2005 p 27 privacy breaches can occur when people benefits from transactions using a third person s personal information without that person being a part of that transaction varian 1997 asymmetrical information also occurs since benefits occurring from taking privacy protecting measures cannot be measured deterministic and uncertain since benefits may be stochastic and rely on other new arbitrary distributions acquisti grossklags 2005 p 27 acquisti further say that people have tendency to take decisions that favor immediate gratifications even if they know that the decision may be hurt them in the long run an example of this would be a student on 18 limited income deciding to install a free antivirus software with limited capabilities benefits associated with protection against privacy intrusion are often recognized only after the privacy violations have taken place if the damage involves financial loss which can be quantified it becomes easy to see the benefits that could have prevented the damage by implementing protection measures but often these benefits are more complex multifaceted and are context specific this research informs the audience the connection between security as a function of information that makes it an area of investigation under the discipline of information sciences 12 introduction to the problem statement 121 positive online leads to positive offline behavior research and practice indicate that computer users including internet users generally mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior yee bailenson ducheneaut 2009 in fact this robust onlineoffline relationship is a fundamental tenet of computer training which anticipates that online training of positive concepts and activities should reinforce positive offline beliefs and performance eastmond 1995a matthews 1999 moore kearsley 2011 robst 2007 vrasidas 2000 surprisingly relatively little research has focused on the relationship between negative online and negative offline behaviors 122 negative online leads to negative offline behavior training reinforces many behaviors konijn 2000 but it is the training context that determines whether the reinforcement effects are positive or negative negative 19 behaviors are those that can have an adverse effect on the wellbeing and performance of those who were the target burnes pope 2007 this research focuses on the dark side of the training relationship suggesting that online training of negative concepts and activities should likewise reinforce negative offline beliefs and performance negative behaviors are those that border on incivility aggression violence pearson andersson wegner 2001 impetuous behavior is defined as behavior with negative connotation which is characterized with people acting on a sudden idea without considering the results of their actions urban dictionary impetuous 2016 it also means reckless or irresponsible behavior meltzer 2005 this study also considers impetuous behaviors to include risqu behaviors that are sexuallysuggestive behaviors which can border on being uncivil sexual harassment rude insensitive sexual advances and disrespectful p brown levinson 1987 table 11 type of behaviors behaviors online offline impetuous risqu sexually suggestive sexting flaming sending rude messages cussing posting suggestive images ftf flirting risky

translate in to second nature konijn 2000which the users may mimic in the offline environment mckenna green 2002 it is possible to create new habits through repetition of the behavior neal et al 2006 therefore research indicates undesirable online behavior can lead to highlyundesirable offline behavior and even tragic results jessica logan 2015 ryan halligan the story 2015 the tragic megan meier story 2015 the tragic story of tyler clementi 2015 thus this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems 124 the problem of inadequate parental internet supervision and control inadequate parental supervision and control of children s online behavior morrongiello kane zdzieborski 2011 morrongiello read et al 2011 contributes to negative offline behavior previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children morrongiello kane et al 2011 this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior newcomb loeb 1999 substance use violent behavior early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults are some of the negative behaviors beets et al 2009 bullying others at workplace burnes pope 2007 is extension of negative aggressive behaviors other negative behaviors include truancy bullying 21 insubordination disrespect tardiness fighting stealing and vandalism p brown levinson 1987 another factor that influences the onset of problematic online behavior in young internet users is largely attributable to inadequate parental supervision and control over their offspring morrongiello kane zdzieborski 2011 morrongiello read et al 2011 previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children including the content or genre video or game media preferred by their children therefore they exert little supervisory control over the internet activity of their children morrongiello kane et al 2011 this demonstrated lack of concern suggests a deficiency of online parenting behavior newcomb loeb 1999 games and simulation overlap aircraft

randel morris wetzel 1992 simulation techniques are helpful to train the students achieve accuracy in low frequency events such as emergency landing procedures and processes that have irreversible outputs such as surgical procedures damassa sitko 2010 parenting behavior is bidimensional support conduct that characterizes parental attitude towards their children hoeve et al 2009 positive support occurs when children experience parental warmth acceptance approval and responsiveness to their needs maccoby martin 1983 rohner 2004 similarly negative support occurs when 22 children experience parental hostility insensitivity lack of communication and intimacy neglect and rejection hoeve et al 2009 holden 1997 maccoby martin 1983 rohner 2004 rollins thomas 1979 at home parents today are providing less childrearing guidance for their children than their own parents provided them baumrind 1971 zervides 2007 this is evident in the findings of study conducted by zervide and knoles 2007 which shows that there has been a trend of changes of parental rearing styles from authoritarian to authoritative to more lenient and democratic styles zervides 2007 prior research has indicated those young teenagers who regard parental rearing behaviors as being over meddling disciplinary and lacking in approachability has led to the problematic use of the internet in the youth suggesting that the influences of parenting style and family function are important factors in the development of internet dependency mengchen med 2010 previous research in context to the children sustaining injuries show that many children today have access to private bedrooms jiow lim 2012 olson et al 2007 often spent considerable amount of their awake time unsupervised and unmonitored and that lessened control is often linked with increased children s risky behaviors harrell 2003 morrongiello corbett mccourt johnston 2006 morrongiello kane et al 2011 such children are also likely to have access to such genres of video games that are most likely to be violent and matured content jiow lim 2012 olson et al 2007 the reasons for this could be that parents face many challenges in monitoring and supervising children because todays contemporary parents have to juggle their personal professional life often facing adversity in face of magnifying socialisolation and their various social professional and family commitments parenting today nd these 23 challenges include limitations affecting their ability to continuously monitor children playing together or alone both which include playing video games livingstone 2007 livingstone helsper 2008 nikken jansz 2006 for example single parents or those who are timeconstrained are more likely to allow video and computer games to baby sit their children keeping them engaged indoors and occupied but unsupervised cauchon 2005 harms clifford 1989 wilsondoenges 2001 worley 2011 such timeconstrained parents have selfreported that they lack time and technical expertise to understand video games and are more than likely to stop monitoring and supervision over period of time as they perceive their children to possess superior technical expertise to their own oosting ijsselsteijn kort 2008 parents have also rationalized their indifference toward inappropriate content in video games because they believe that their children are unaffected by these games violent video games and young people 2008 according to pro cons videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal

control supervision and monitoring not only at home but they may also face similar circumstances at schools where lack of supervision monitoring and guidance would impact children to behave risqu in school environment in preinternet society parents exercised a more dominant role in raising their children and instilling values comer 1993 gillies 2008 grusec 2002 but in contemporary society with many parents working as parents provide less guidance for their children at home research indicates that more parents throughout the world harbor an expectation that schools assume that dominant role in teaching supervising and mentoring children s behavior dinham scott 2000 at school parents today expect more childrearing guidance be provided for their children than their schools provided them grolnick friendly bellas 2009 steinberg lamborn dornbusch darling 25 1992 usher kober 2012 zervides 2007 parents thus harbor expectations from the schools to provide the necessary supervision to their children although parents still want their children to mature into responsible citizens in the contemporary societies parents expect the school authorities to assume most of the responsibility towards this goal expecting the schools to do most of the work associated with imparting knowledge as well as values comer 1993 delattre delattre 2005 however parents are reluctant to allow schools to take disciplinary actions against their children barge loges 2003 ferrara ferrar 2005 georgiou 2008 as a result of this school children are often likely to receive little or no discipline what so ever ferrara ferrar 2005 school environments thus are often less effective in fulfilling the expectation of contemporary parents in the area of being able to teach basic values to their children and thus are ineffective in fulfilling the expectation of the society in large edmonds 1979 mcevoy welker 2000 olweus 1994 lack of disciplinary actions from school authorities can lead to increase in disruptive behaviors in school nelson martella galand 1998 studies also have indicated students have engaged in menacing actions including stalking bullying physical or verbal assaults and hijacking classrooms kuhlenschmidt layne 1999 schneider 1998 which makes understanding this behavior important in context to our research overall sociologists and legal authorities indicate that contemporary children receive less than adequate disciplinary guidance or supervision at home or at school ferrara ferrar 2005 pang 2009 there is yet another dimension to the disruptive behaviors of the children that is seen in public situations less than adequate child rearing guidance at home and school is likely to influence children s behavior in the society that can impact the citizens of the 26 society at large ferrara ferrar 2005 pang 2009 kelly 2007 reported in new york times an issue that exemplified disruptive and unruly behavior in a public library in new jersey community kelly 2007 every

purpose current study facebook and is relevance not much research has been conducted on impetuous impression management or 34 the reasons for teenager and young adults for impetuous risqu impression projection in an online environment and more specifically in facebook this research therefore proposes to study the factors that influences people impetuous image projection on facebook the purpose of this research is to fill the identified research gap sidorova et al 2008 identified how information technology it systems are developed and how individuals groups organizations and markets interact with it sidorova evangelopoulos valacich ramakrishnan 2008 therefore research on facebook corresponds to one of the core research areas of it systems as identified by sidorova et al 2008 namely how groups interact with it sidorova et al 2008 as a group ware technology that relies on the interaction between their users facebook has generated tremendous value due to its vast expansion of its

megan meier story 2015 the tragic story of tyler clementi 2015 this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems the above discussion informs that impetuous risqu behavior generally falls into the undesirable outcomes of online activities of the users of facebook 131 impetuous and risky behaviors this research considers two kinds of behavior impetuous and risky in both online and offline environments however this study focuses on impetuous behavior an example of impetuous behavior is the risqu behavior which is slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being sexually suggestive oxford dictionaries risque 2016 common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann 2011 roberts 2012 36 risky behavior encompasses the possibility of danger failure or loss oxford dictionaries risky 2016 as such both behaviors exist in online and offline environments with overlapping but often distinct consequences benotsch et al 2013 132 impetuous onlineoffline versus risky onlineoffline behaviors impetuous and risky online behaviors contribute to negative risqu and risky offline behaviors this research therefore defines impetuous online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment eg sexting lohmann 2011 flaming kayany 1998 similarly in this study impetuous offline behavior is defined as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior that includes being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment wilson brazendale 1973 substance use violent behavior early initiation of sexual activity and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and young adults beets et al 2009 truancy bullying insubordination disrespect

behavior including having multiple sexual partners unprotected sex and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections benotsch et al 2013 online smart phone dating applications like tinder grindr growlr scruff has been used by men and women to connect with other men and women exhibiting risqu sexual behavior which culminates in to offline casual sexual encounters with total strangers woo 2015 impetuous behavior can be hazardous to this population for two reasons 1 younger users invest a lot of time in the internet particularly in its social features burnay billieux blairy laroi 2015 laconi tricard chabrol 2015 lu yeo 2015 and 2 a significant number these younger users engage in risqu online behaviors ie behaviors that are considered undesirable provocative andor highrisk in current society black stone johnson 2015 peluchette karl 2010 shah 2010 wahdan nimr kotb wahdan 2014 a concern of this research is that 1 and 2 can cyclically reinforce and feed each other yielding accumulating undesirable results for individuals and for society this research seeks to break this cycle and to prevent its recurrence 134 suggestive risqu or negative online behavior risqu is behavior that slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being 38 sexually suggestive oxford dictionaries nd common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann 2011 roberts 2012 what is sexting nude or risque pics sent by teens expose them to serious legal and social consequences 2009 this research therefore defines risqu online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment it is mostly indecent as in sexting flirting and scandalous behavior as in posting provocative images in an online environment risqu is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy definition of risqu nd example risqu behavior includes flaming behavior which has been defined as uninhibited behavior in

environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment this type of behavior has been extensively described in popular as well as academic literatures wilson and brazendale 1973 conducted a study where they described appropriation of suggestive offline behavior by conducting an experiment that involved 39 using what they described as risqu slides of seaside postcards based largely on sexual innuendo to administer a humor test g d wilson brazendale 1973 recently the wall

discussed extensively in academic literature fishburn kochenberger 1979 krueger dickson 1994 1343 dangerous risky offline behavior this research defines dangerous risky offline behavior as behavior

popular media have discussed whether risqu content should be allowed or not on facebook brown 2013 facebook s porn cops 2010 shapira nd however there is not much empirical study conducted on this wide observed behavior pattern of facebook users impression management thus assumes central position in this research because this work emphasizes the importance of shaping teenager personalities to become welladapted and productive citizens in future technological society impression management has been extensively researched in sociology and psychology disciplines 42 kr mer winter 2008 the framework has been applied in various practical applications as public relations piwinger ebert 2001 forensic literature perri lichtenwald 2010 in the area of sports and psychology ginis lindwall prapavessis 2007 and offline social behaviors like eating disordersherman roth polivy 2003 facebook has also been researched extensively wilson et al 2012 135 teenage behavior and gaming dill and dill 1999 showed that there are factors that influence the relationship between video games and increased violence video games that harness the violenceappeal are built on instant gratification there is an instant reward or penalty for carrying out the violent act in a game for instance a kill segment will instantly gain the user with a jackpot reward or allow the user to continue to the next level here the gamer identifies with the character in the game in first person these emblematic aggressions impact the psychology of the player as the player controls the character of the game and therefore the player experiences the act of aggression as seen through the eyes of the character in the game dill dill 1999 understanding the impact of video games on student s psyche is also important from the is discipline perspective 1351 how is gaming relevant to information systems gaming is in many ways relevant to is and this study because this work recognizes a convergence of is user and gaming user requirements entertainment software association esa reported that of 155 million americans that played videogames 26 43 of the gamers are less than 18 years of age and an average of 65 hrs per week

such parents almost do not check the ratings of the videogames that are purchased by the children carnagey anderson 2004 according to procons videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres charts graphs on video games youth violence 2015 further research indicates that violent video games desensitize children at an early age to the effects of violence carnagey anderson bushman 2007 research also indicates that it is possible for undeveloped minds of the children to get heavily influenced by these violent themes gunter 1998 research further indicates this influence induced by the content of the violence in the games can lead to acts of violence and aggression sherry 2001thus some of the impacts when parents do not supervise their children s offline behavior includes increased violent and aggressive behavior increased highrisk behaviors including alcohol and tobacco use

uncontrollability bargh 1994 this automatic behavior is to referred to as second nature konijn 2000 repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior the direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature konijn 2000 is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set bargh 1994 and by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment gaming will thus impact transition of online risqu behavior to offline risky behavior tipping the balance in favor of criminal mindset thus 46 upsetting the equilibrium and balance that modern society enjoys gaming represents an avenue to

behavior or skill set results in improving grasping learning a skill set or behavior user will break down the skill sets in to skill chunks and will perform each chunk of that behavior or skill until the entire skill set becomes second nature ericsson et al 48 1993 repetitive gaming thus influences second nature tendencies that translate into contextual offline behavior the direction of this discussion leads to the logical conclusion that second nature which is developed by practicing and mastering a skill set by playing a game of violent genre although in online environment can turn in to an automated response or behavior which the users will try to mimic in the offline environment the online environment that involves a dangerous or criminal fantasy can thus have problematic implications anderson bushman 2001 anderson dill 2000 funk et al 2004 prensky 2006 przybylski et al 2009 1353 how is gaming relevant to impression management gaming influences the goal relevance of the user s impression motivation which is a dimension of impression motivation ericsson et al 1993 gimeno garc amas 2010 leary kowalski 1990 pintrich 2000 schlenker forsyth leary miller 1980 there are two variables in impression management impression motivation the predictor and impression construction the dependent variable expectancyvalue approach to selfpresentation suggests that people are motivated to project images that can get them the maximum returns and allows people to manipulate trade offs between costs and rewards as they deal with their impression management on other people schlenker et al 1980 leary and kowalski 1990 described goal relevance of impressions as an antecedent to impression motivation these researchers linked achievement of relevant goals that includes social and material outcomes as factors that influences impression motivation leary kowalski 1990 49 136 teenage behavior and facebook 1361 how is facebook relevant to information systems facebook in its own right has proved to be a learning artifact that can promote the social constructivist framework that explores the social interactions amongst the users ractham et al 2012 which constitutes one of the core research area of is vessey et al 2002 in this study we have concentrated on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by studying how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online risqu behavior of students on social networking sites and in this way our paper represents a mainstream area of information science is research and contributes to the development of the discipline 1362 why facebook is relevant to this research to address the issues related to uncertainty associated with facebook research wilson et al 2012 studied and identified 412

peak prybutok nd 1363 why facebook is relevant to impression management previous research in psychology describes three goals that motivates people to manage their impressions when they perceive that those impressions are relevant to fulfilment of those goals leary 1995 leary kowalski 1990 people engage in self presentation as a means of creating their identities baumeister 1982 gollwitzer 1986 they are also motivated to maintain and enhance their selfesteem jones 1973 morris rosenberg schooler schoenbach rosenberg 1995 and they use impression management to acquire their desired social and material wants schlenker 1980 tedeschi 2013 as already discussed in the above section facebook is used by people for acquiring social desired outcomes as described in theme 4 and for identity presentation as described in theme 3 facebook has also been studied extensively in the context of self esteem b achnio przepiorka pantic 2016 greitemeyer 2016 52 skues williams wise 2012 subramanian wise davis bhandari morris 2014 tazghini siedlecki 2013 1364 relevance of impression management to is vessey et al 2002 lists the topics that are studies under is research vessey et al 2002 some of those topics include systemssoftware management concepts project management risk management personnel issues problems domain specific concepts information systems including group support systems organizational concepts strategies cultural implications societal concepts cultural implications ethical implications vessey et al 2002 these topics can be linked to the topics studied under impression management im leary and kowalski 1990 describe im to have consisted of topics such as goal relevance of impressions value of desired goals discrepancy between desired and current image impression construction construct of self desired and undesired identity images role constraints targets value and current or potential image it is concluded that impression management covers a wide spectrum of core research areas in information systems impression management can thus be seen to have a direct relevance to is research 137 groupware technology when technologies are designed in such a way that they serve the purpose of facilitating human interactions with the system rather than systems being used to solve some problems they are called groupware systems groupware is defined as computer based systems that supports groups of people engaged in a common task or goals and 53 that provide an interface to a shared environment ellis gibbs rein 1991 christopherson 2007 studied influences of anonymity in computermediated communication cmc and sia etal 2002 study that looked at group polarization using groupware conferencing apparatus that utilized text based communications indicates that facebook is groupware technology 14 problem statement the usage of sns and the computer mediated communication media has been appropriated beyond its intended use this study concentrates on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by exploring how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online behavior of students on social networking sites and in this way our paper represents a mainstream area of information science is research and contributes to the development of the discipline this study attempts to study the impression motivation which is the awareness that facebook is being used for uses other than the intended uses on the image construction which is the behavior exhibited through their online profile images the current research proposes to investigate balancing of the tradeoff between perceived privacy concerns and an active social media presence the proposed generalized research question of this dissertation is do active social media presence and various privacy concerns have any influence on student s online behaviors on social media this research will investigate this question in three different studies as following essay 1 investigates impression management theory as applied to social networking the growth of social networking sites in the last few years has changed the 54 pattern of its utility thereby providing yet another new social phenomenon essay 1 focus on the business implications by investigating the intention of recruiting managers to use social networking sites like facebook and myspace to conduct checks on prospective job candidates also school authorities and law enforcement have occasionally used facebook evidence for taking actions because they have been able to confirm or trace of criminal activities using the framework of impression management theory this study examines how online behavior of students is related to visibility awareness social networking site information trust and awareness of various features of technology essay 1 thus examines if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as visibility awareness and privacy concerns which is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave responsibly which is operationalized as responsible image on social media in essay 2 i extend essay 1 and fill in the research gap to investigate the negative impression management of students on facebook i focus on the risks associated with negative or risqu online behavior of students that can get mimicked to risky offline behaviors often leading to tragic results using the framework of impression management theory i examine how negative online behavior of students is related to students portraying different personalities by selectively disclosing their personas aided by awareness of various privacy features of technology essay 2 thus explores if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as selective disclosure and desired differential personas and privacy concerns that is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave negatively which is operationalized as negative or risqu image on social media 55 in essay 3 i extend the conceptual framework of essay 1 and look at trust and privacy of social networking while investigating factors influencing student behavior on facebook in the context of impression management with this study i aim to extend the previous studies by using the framework of trust in digital information to investigate privacy and security concerns related to the use of social networking this essay is still a work in progress and i am in the process of analyzing data essay 3 researches if factors such as dimensions of active social media presence such as impression motivation and information trustworthiness and privacy concerns operationalized as technology awareness influences students to have distinct impression management operationalized as image construction on social media my investigation shows that the impression management framework serves as the most important base model for predictors of social networking behaviors to increase the awareness of information and cyber security in order to promote the best security practices each essay has been built by reviewing the existing literature in social networking cyber security and information systems theories to increase the awareness of privacy and security concerns related with problematic use of the internet the research and the frameworks posited allow us to identify relevant concerns and directions for further research my work posits and supports new theory development and shows the overarching importance of researching privacy and security in social network analysis as a major organizational construct 15 research design the rest of this study is organized as below the next section describes 56 generalized literature review that discusses the periphery of the problem area the three research essays follow this each research essay is organized with its own introduction literature review statement of hypotheses research model methodology proposed instruments data analysis discussion and implications and limitations, chapter  introduction and problem statement  subject area  importance of social media research webbased social networking is in a general sense changing the way we interact team up appropriate and create they signify the most effective change driven results of information technology on businesses impacted by professional and personal lives of the stakeholders aral dellarocas godes  social networking is a ubiquitous phenomenon it has percolated not only the personal lives of its users but it has also impacted the professional domains thereby making its way in to the main stream business discipline enforced public visibility is the direct consequences of the omnievolving appropriation of social media an example of user being forced to use social media can be an online job portal like linkedin or facebook that helps people to stay connected with their friends and families recent studies indicate that people have started appropriating social media in aiding their businesses kaplan haenlein b k rkk inen jussila v is nen  treem leonardi  dutta  argues that every businessperson must now have a personal social media strategy today s leaders must embrace social media for three reasons first they provide a lowcost platform on which to build your personal brand communicating who you are both within and outside your company second they allow you to engage rapidly and simultaneously with peers employees customers and the broader public especially younger generations in the same transparent and direct way they expect from everyone in their lives third they give you an opportunity to learn from instant information and unvarnished feedback dutta  p  research in social media includes investigating activities of its users and the level of those investigations aral et al  classifies areas of activities in to four broad  categories namely design and features strategy and tactics management organization and measurement value at three levels namely consumers and society platforms and intermediaries and firms and industries aral et al  p  i am addressing the problem domain that broadly considers intersection of design features of social media analyzed at the level of and platforms and intermediaries research associated with design and features includes investigating the appropriation of features of social networking by different stakeholders such as individuals in social context and individuals in context of business users this category depicts how patrons companies and governments use explicit social media features and how these technologies are made available to the users at the same time design research also considers how constrains can be enforced to prevent misappropriation of the same features thus design looks in to standardizing and regulating the various facets of social media development and implementation individuals businesses or governments are the users of social media which constitutes platforms and intermediaries that continuously innovate and grow using the platform of social media such as twitter facebook etc aral et al  have listed some of the research agendas which lie in the intersection of my research domain of interest they are how can users optimize their use of social media which objectives do users pursue in using social media how can users create relationships curate information broaden their reach and maximize their influence what are the benefits and risks associated with use of social media what is the nonmonetary value that social media create eg equality health violence civic engagement  how do specific features and designs help platforms attract users create engagement enable and constrain user behavior and increase revenue how can platforms maximize their influence and revenue should platforms be open or closed standardized or ad hoc aral et al  process of social interactions is complex and governed by societal norms social media features are designed and developed in such a way that they enforce constraints on the user behavior to conform to the societal norms social media thus exhibit candid impact on the societal framework aral et al  social media is the futuristic phenomenon intricately associated with human behavior and in the emerging era of the internet of things its understanding has become critical for new directions in development of technologies one of the emerging trends of the appropriation of social media includes the talent acquisition process where companies have started appropriating social networks to track talent to match to the open positions aral et al  linkedin is one such example where a service that began as a job portal emerged in to a social media where the jobseekers do not have to pay for registration and create a profile garg and telang  reported that features in linkedin such as connections which can either be further classified as weak or strong serves different purposes weak ties help the individual to come across a job lead while the strong ties and first connection helps an individual to get job interview as well as job offer garg telang  the site slowly developed to include features that encouraged the job seekers to update much more information than just their resume the features of endorsing skills which essentially is a part of social network analysis is appropriated by the employers to gather much more information about the candidate to be able to perform a close fit of the talent to the open positions premium services are created both for the job seekers and the employers  hence it is thus seen that many job portals have emerged in to becoming social networking sites the concept being social networking encourages users to upload much more social information in context of the talent acquisition this makes more information available to both the parties the job seekers and the employers on one hand jobseekers gain more information such as average salaries that a position can command best working conditions perks and benefits and so on on the other hand the employers can gather much more information about the candidate apart which gives them the ability to match the right candidate to the right job this kind of appropriation has transformed the job portals into something much more giving the service providers competitive edge w kim jeong lee  schwartz  evolution of social media in this direction gives rise to the considerations that users can use to strategically position themselves on the social media in order to realize their goals pertaining to their career choices research in social media and social networking is still in its embryonic stage and is emerging the above research has introduced my specific area of research interest in the information related phenomenon that is observed in the emergence of social media the above section also leads us to finding out why social networking is an area of interest under the discipline of information sciences  social networking in context of impression management social networking sites have been a focus of empirical research and have been studied from the perspective of impression management in various interdisciplinary studies such as psychology sociology computermediated communications etc  rosenberg and egbert  studied the utility of personality traits and secondary goals as predictors of selfpresentation tactics employed by facebook users secondary goals are recurring motivations in an individual s life and include identity goals interaction goals personal resource goals and arousal management goals dillard segrin harden  rosenberg and egbert reported that individual personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals and that secondary goals predicted the use of various selfpresentation tactics used on facebook results indicated that these personality traits and secondary goals are both theoretically and empirically sound components for the conceptualization of online impression management rosenberg egbert  this study prompts further research in self presentation on facebook considering the effect of audience segmentation and how individuals deal with problems of multiple audiences having access to their profile and being witnesses to their activity on facebook such as friends versus family members lampe ellison steinfield  lampe ellison steinfield  stutzman  for instance a child may experience uncertainty when parent would want to be added to the child s facebook page the child may not want the parent to view hisor her facebook page i have engaged this theme in my research essay where i investigated factors affecting online behavior of people living with hiv and aids on facebook where one of the construct i have looked at is the selective disclosure in context of stigma faced by people living with hiv allbright  conducted a study to investigate relationship formation over computer mediated communication channels contrary to notion where physical proximity and cues such as eye contact body language etc have been seen as critical to the  formation of attraction this study investigates how relationships are formed online without physical proximity and cues a popular belief about online profiles is that people are more likely to construct false profiles with respect to their true age class and even gender using goffmans theory of impression management and literature on deception in communication this study compared the first impression people formed online with the second impression formed offline and the reason for any disparity in the two impressions albright reported that most people were honest with each other online and the majority of participants reported being as or more attracted to their online lovers with increased information via phone calls photos exchanged and face to face meetings most misimpressions in these relationships were the result of respondents filling in the blanks incorrectly or idealization rather than being victims of overt deception albright gives direction for future research in three areas she points out that not much research has been conducted in the areas of projection and idealization secondly she urges the researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate if these relationships are more viable long term than those formed in facetoface contexts and lastly albright recommends that further investigations are needed to assess why some relationships never move out of the online environment to a facetoface meeting albright  using albrights themes one area that i have looked in to is the invisibility issue face by communities of people living with hiv and aids in context of the stigma associated with the disease i have looked at solution space for people having concerns about disclosing their identities to use sns as a platform to be able to meet other people living with hiv with the aim of forming longterm relationships in my research study titled benefits and  risks associated with using secret facebook support group for people living with hiv and aids snss constitute an important research context for scholars investigating processes of impression management selfpresentation and friendship performance in one of the earliest academic articles on snss boyd  examined friendster as a locus of publicly articulated social networks that allowed users to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others donath boyd  donath and boyd  extended this to suggest that public displays of connection serve as important identity signals that help people navigate the networked social world in that an extended network may serve to validate identity information presented in profiles donath boyd  in listing user motivations for friending boyd  points out that friends on snss are not the same as friends in the everyday sense instead friends provide context by offering users an imagined audience to guide behavioral norms  social networking in context of cyber security within social media research another problem domain is the cyber security concerns social media use has been appropriated in industry espionage spying and social media dos and don ts for guerrilla marketing in the internet age albrecht  algarni xu chan  alge braun esswein  braun esswein  gaff  hall  hill a hill b judge  molok ahmad chang  nuha molok  salminen degbey  villarreal  studies have been conducted that investigates identity theft in context of social networking sites participants in social network sites create selfdescriptive profiles that include their links  to other members creating a visible network of connections the ostensible purpose of these sites is to use this network to make friends dates and business connections donath boyd  p consider a case of social climber who can build an impressive r sum by namedropping of famous people as his friends benefiting from the fact that the listener is unable to verify the authenticity these connections displayed publicly in social networking sites indicate signals that represent attributes or qualities for e g a person who uploads images that displays music studios in back ground and has other famous musicians in the picture along with him signals that probably he belongs to the music industry because public display of connection implies verification of identity and can be viewed as a signal of the reliability of one s identity claims donath boyd  p  public display of connections can also help someone else establish that they are you too donath boyd  p  participants in social networks make their personal social world information publicly available which can be appropriated in social engineering attacks by the perpetrators or used by the perpetrators for identity theft the rapid growth of social networking sites sns like facebook or linkedin has a dramatic effect on identity theft for two main reasons a meur and sch nfeld  studied identity theft in the context of the facebook their work reported that since facebook has the largest database that contains qualitative as well as quantitative data on its users personal information perpetrators have found it to be lucrative for conducting identity theft attacks in  the database of facebook was compromised and it was discovered that  million accounts along with their associated data was available on sale at all time low price of  usd per  contacts idefense  million facebook accounts for sale  also once the user uploads the information in facebook the  user loses all control over that information there has been ambiguity in the transparency relate to the protection of the privacy of its users and the ownership of the uploaded content on the facebook another security concern faced my most social networking sites is its registration mechanism snss do not validate the users identity with any authentication mechanism eg using driving license or ssn to validate if the user is whom the user says is since anybody can create a profile by any name upload any content to that profile this can lead to direct identity theft anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages a meur sch nfeld  p  hackers can hack in to legitimate facebook accounts and collect personal information not only about the user but also collect information about the users friends and their friends a second major threat of sns concerns the registration process actually sns do not check the identity of the users and anyone can assume any name without control these procedures could lead directly to identity theft with dire consequences for the reputation of the real persons anyone can create a profile with the identity of a public figure like politicians or famous artists and begin a campaign of discredit by posting hate messages the theft of legitimate accounts is also easy in sns and the hackers use the information contained in the profile itself to take possession of it a last point about sns is to know in which measure we can trust these systems for the protection of data most of these sites are actually free of charge for the users and their only source of income is derived from targeted advertising the resale or the right of access to personal data for advertisers constitutes an enormous information security breach   social networking in context of information science borko  defines information science is as that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information the forces that governs the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability borko further says that information science is related to mathematics logic linguistics psychology computer technology operations research the graphic arts communications library science management and other similar fields and consists of a pure science component which inquires in to the subject without regards to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products  boyd and ellison defines social network sites sns as webbased services that allow individuals to  construct a public or semipublic profile within a bounded system  articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and  view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system  from the above two definitions we see that sns are web based services a component included in the borko s definition allowing exchange of information as individuals construct profiles and articulate list of other users with whom they establish connections to share their profiles messages pictures in short information wilson  in his work human information behavior provides the definition of information seeking behavior information seeking behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal in the course of seeking the individual may interact with manual information systems such as a newspaper or a library or with computerbased systems such as the world wide web wilson  p   ashgar  recognized the popularity of facebook as a source of information and his work resulted in the development of item scale of information seeking in facebook isfs that looked at information seeking behavior and other motives such as socialization entertainment selfseeking diversion in facebook usage the study involved administering the scale to  facebook users and analysis of the data showed strong reliability of cronbach s alpha as  the study used several selfreport measures such as general social media usage online friendships facebook friendships and social media use integration to obtain a strong construct validity validity and reliability support suggests that isfs information seeking in facebook scale can be used to measure information seeking behavior on social networking sites like facebook asghar  this research has identified a research gap it was shown by junco  that information seeking in facebook is associated with student engagement or performance indicating that collecting and sharing information through facebook was a positive predictor of academic performance gpa junco  while socialization and time spent on facebook were negative predictors of gpa time spent on facebook was only weakly related to the time spent preparing for class asghar  this implies that there must be another process that must be in play that can relate the relationship between facebook use and gpa  information science in context of impression management impression management im a term originated by erving goffman  describes a central aspect of role theory how individual actors create maintain defend and often enhance their social identities through assumptions settings props and scripts  in a play metaphor dillard et al  goffman  and schlenker  im explains the motivations behind complex human interactions and performances in the age of information use and control of information plays a pivotal role in our day to day routine impression management controls and regulates the information that people manipulate in order to influence the impressions they form on other people it s an activity driven by goals shlenker  says that people try to manage impressions of a person eg self friends enemies object eg a business organization a gift a consumer product event eg a transgression a task performance or idea eg prolife versus prochoice policies capitalism versus socialism through a processes of impression management schlenker  when people try to manage impressions on others about themselves the process is termed as selfpresentation the origins of impression management can be traced back to erving goffman  where he uses the metaphor of world stage to describe role theory where every person is an actor and will act their part through social complex interactions and social identities im is the goaldirected attempt to influence others perceptions about a person a group andor an organization regarding an object or event by providing selfassessed beneficial information in social interactions the goal for the aforementioned attempt is to gain an advantageous first impression the motive for this goal is based on the assumption that the target audience s impressions about the individuals groups or organizations become reality of the target audience goffman  leary kowalski  on the im stage the target audience can be either real or imaginary the impression exists in the subliminal level through socialization and generally does not manifest until the actor either succeeds or fails to resonate with the target audience and in turn the  targeted audience transforms the performance of the actor into the reality of the target audience figure goffman s impression management model one of the prime concepts in impression management is role constraints social roles carry expectations regarding how individuals who occupy those roles are to behave sarbin allen  the failure to convey impressions consistent with ones role not only diminishes ones effectiveness in that role but also in many cases can lead the individual to lose the right to enact that role goffman  conveying impressions is effectively the communication process requiring that the process needs both sending and receiving of information linking role constraints to the study under information science goffman  provided an insightful analysis of the role governed nature of selfpresentation his observations included the analysis of how people behave when they are not in front of their target audience goffman notes that in back stage ie when the target audience is absent the actor individuals will come out of their role governed acting the actor will relax behaviors will be more regressed involving informal dialects or lingo using openly sexual remarks and a kidding attitude  p  goffman went on to raise the interesting question of whether a backstage gives individuals an opportunity to regress or whether regression inappropriate occasions that are not socially  accepted brings out the regressed or back stage behavior  p  studying user behavior is a domain under the specialty of user theory which is one of the main sub disciplines in information science white mccain  p  impression management finally refers to current or potential social image finally the impressions people try to create are affected both by how they think they are currently regarded by others and by how they think others may perceive them in the future on the basis of future revelations about them for example public failures and embarrassing events compel people to engage in impressionable strategies designed to counter or repair the damaged image goffman  information science also includes analytical study of learned literatures and their social contexts white mccain  p  wilson  describes the intedisciplinarity of information science discipline information science is not the only discipline to be concerned with the user and use of information mention has been made earlier of the role of the user requirements phase in the design of computerbased systems but other disciplines also have an interest from different perspectives for example psychological studies of personality have dealt with information processing and cognition wilson  p  the above research informs the audience on the connectedness between information science and impression management  information science and cyber security  fuzzy logic information science and cyber security uncertainty is one of the basic facets of human cognition the concept of a generalized constraint and its fundamental premise is that information may be viewed as a generalized constraint the generalized theory of uncertainty proposed by zadeh  increases our understanding of the foundations of information and uncertainty  uncertainty is linked to information through the concept of granular structure a concept which plays a key role in human interaction with the real world higashi klir  zadeh  granulation is inescapable in human cognition the concept of defining linguistic variables where possible values for the variable age could be young middleaged and old entwines with the concept of granularity zedeh  connection between granulation of attribute and the use of linguistic variable can be explained by the fact that cognitive capabilities of human sensory organs and brain have limited ability to store information for example looking at monika i see that she is young but cannot pinpoint her age as a single number zadeh  p  the concept of a linguistic variable plays a pivotal role in almost all applications of fuzzy logic dubois prade yager  yager filev  the above research informs the connection between information

operated remotely such as track switches traffic signals electric circuit breakers valves relays sensors and water and gas pumps many of these networks that were  already implemented in infrastructures were developed with little or no consideration towards security and they thus have become susceptible to being easy targets of attacks by terrorist groups kumar et al further reports that scada network are extremely popular in the field of industrial production due to its natural propinquity for its use of internet and wireless technologies allowing automatic monitoring of remote facilities modern scada networks integrated with corporate networks and the internet have become far more vulnerable to unauthorized cyberattacks patel et al  p   security as a function of information asymmetries in a nobel prize winning work economist george akerlof in  discuss markets with asymmetric information akerlof showed informational asymmetries could produce adverse selection in market asymmetric information is a common feature of market interactions as cited in lofgren persson weibull  p  with respect to quality of the products seller often is better informed than the buyer in case of security products security product vendor s projects often try to market the capabilities of their products software security returns on investment are often intangible roi is the present value of accumulated net benefits over a certain time period divided by the initial costs of investments jermanbla i  p  in case of information security cost can easily be computed as it is the cost of the information security products and the cost of operations benefits of implementing security measures are intangible it is very difficult to define assess or measure the benefits firewalls ids antivirus software and other security solutions do not generate revenue that can be measured jermanbla i  p  prior research indicates the benefits resulting from information security  investment are measured as cost savings that result from preventing information security breaches gordon loeb  the vendors know that the buyers will not be able to assess the benefits and often get away with quoting high prices for the security products since buyers are not able to trust the vendor s claims buyers are disinclined in high investments in security measures vendors are thus disinclined to invest in development of high quality security products anderson moore  the seller of a good often knows more about its quality than the prospective buyer the job applicant typically knows more about his ability than his potential employer lofgren persson weibull  because buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for quality they cannot measure buyers often determines the prices they are willing to pay at those prices sellers are only able to offer low quality products the software market suffers from the same information asymmetry when personal information will be used in privacy decisionmaking and how it would be used is knowledge only amongst subset of the decision makers leads to privacy violations caused by asymmetric information incomplete information affects privacy decisions acquisti grossklags  p  privacy breaches can occur when people benefits from transactions using a third person s personal information without that person being a part of that transaction varian  asymmetrical information also occurs since benefits occurring from taking privacy protecting measures cannot be measured deterministic and uncertain since benefits may be stochastic and rely on other new arbitrary distributions acquisti grossklags  p  acquisti further say that people have tendency to take decisions that favor immediate gratifications even if they know that the decision may be hurt them in the long run an example of this would be a student on  limited income deciding to install a free antivirus software with limited capabilities benefits associated with protection against privacy intrusion are often recognized only after the privacy violations have taken place if the damage involves financial loss which can be quantified it becomes easy to see the benefits that could have prevented the damage by implementing protection measures but often these benefits are more complex multifaceted and are context specific this research informs the audience the connection between security as a function of

practice indicate that computer users including internet users generally mimic by their online behavior with their offline behavior yee bailenson ducheneaut  in fact this robust onlineoffline relationship is a fundamental tenet of computer training which anticipates that online training of positive concepts and activities should reinforce positive offline beliefs and performance eastmond a matthews  moore kearsley  robst  vrasidas  surprisingly relatively little research has focused on the relationship between negative online and negative offline behaviors  negative online leads to negative offline behavior training reinforces many behaviors konijn  but it is the training context that determines whether the reinforcement effects are positive or negative negative  behaviors are those that can have an adverse effect on the wellbeing and performance of those who were the target burnes pope  this research focuses on the dark side of the training relationship suggesting that

negative offline behavior previous research shows that many authoritative and permissive parents demonstrate little concern for the internet activity of their children including the content or genre

their children than their own parents provided them baumrind  zervides  this is evident in the findings of study conducted by zervide and knoles  which shows that there has been a trend of changes of parental rearing styles from authoritarian to authoritative to more lenient and democratic styles zervides  prior research has indicated those young teenagers who regard parental rearing behaviors as being over meddling disciplinary and lacking in approachability has led to the problematic use of the internet in the youth suggesting that the influences of parenting style and family function are important factors in the development of internet dependency mengchen med  previous research in context to the children sustaining injuries show that many children today have access to private bedrooms jiow lim  olson et al  often spent considerable amount of their awake time unsupervised and unmonitored and that lessened control is often linked with increased children s risky behaviors harrell  morrongiello corbett mccourt johnston  morrongiello kane et al  such children are also likely to have access to such genres of video games that are most likely to be violent and matured content jiow lim  olson et al  the reasons for this could be that parents face many challenges in monitoring and supervising children because todays contemporary parents have to juggle their personal professional life often facing adversity in face of magnifying socialisolation and their various social professional and family commitments parenting today nd these  challenges include limitations affecting their ability to continuously monitor children playing together or alone both which include playing video games livingstone  livingstone helsper  nikken jansz  for example single parents or those who are timeconstrained are more likely to allow video and computer games to baby sit their children keeping them engaged indoors and occupied but unsupervised cauchon  harms clifford  wilsondoenges  worley  such timeconstrained parents have selfreported that they lack time and technical expertise to understand video games and are more than likely to stop monitoring and supervision over period of time as they perceive their children to possess superior technical expertise to their own oosting ijsselsteijn kort  parents have also rationalized their indifference toward inappropriate content in video

control supervision and monitoring not only at home but they may also face similar circumstances at schools where lack of supervision monitoring and guidance would impact children to behave risqu in school environment in preinternet society parents exercised a more dominant role in raising their children and instilling values comer  gillies  grusec  but in contemporary society with many parents working as parents provide less guidance for their children at home research indicates that more parents throughout the world harbor an expectation that schools assume that dominant role in teaching supervising and mentoring children s behavior dinham scott  at school parents today expect more childrearing guidance be provided for their children than their schools provided them grolnick friendly bellas  steinberg lamborn dornbusch darling   usher kober  zervides  parents thus harbor expectations from the schools to provide the necessary supervision to their children although parents still want their children to mature into responsible citizens in the contemporary societies parents expect the school authorities to assume most of the responsibility towards this goal expecting the schools to do most of the work associated with imparting knowledge as well as values comer  delattre delattre  however parents are reluctant to allow schools to take disciplinary actions against their children barge loges  ferrara ferrar  georgiou  as a result of this school children are often likely to receive little or no discipline what so ever ferrara ferrar  school environments thus are often less effective in fulfilling the expectation of contemporary parents in the area of being able to teach basic values to their children and thus are ineffective in fulfilling the expectation of the society in large edmonds  mcevoy welker  olweus  lack of disciplinary actions from school authorities can lead to increase in disruptive behaviors in school nelson martella galand  studies also have indicated students have engaged in menacing actions including stalking bullying physical or verbal assaults and hijacking classrooms kuhlenschmidt layne  schneider  which makes understanding this behavior important in context to our research overall sociologists and legal authorities indicate that contemporary children receive less than adequate disciplinary guidance or supervision at home or at school ferrara ferrar  pang  there is yet another dimension to the disruptive behaviors of the children that is seen in public situations less than adequate child rearing guidance at home and school is likely to influence children s behavior in the society that can impact the citizens of the  society at large ferrara ferrar  pang  kelly  reported in new york times an issue that exemplified

story of tyler clementi  this paper attempts to highlight one of the major societal problems the above discussion informs that impetuous risqu behavior generally falls into the undesirable outcomes of online activities of the users of facebook  impetuous and risky behaviors this research considers two kinds of behavior impetuous and risky in both online and offline environments however this study focuses on impetuous behavior an example of impetuous behavior is the risqu behavior which is slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being sexually suggestive oxford dictionaries risque  common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann  roberts   risky behavior encompasses the possibility of danger failure or loss oxford dictionaries risky  as such both behaviors exist in online and offline environments with overlapping but often distinct consequences benotsch et al   impetuous onlineoffline versus risky onlineoffline behaviors impetuous and risky online behaviors contribute to negative risqu and risky offline behaviors this research therefore defines impetuous online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment eg sexting lohmann  flaming kayany  similarly in this study impetuous offline behavior is defined as behavior that is carried out in an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior that includes being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment wilson brazendale  substance use violent behavior early initiation of sexual activity and

reinforce and feed each other yielding accumulating undesirable results for individuals and for society this research seeks to break this cycle and to prevent its recurrence  suggestive risqu or negative online behavior risqu is behavior that slightly indecent and liable to shock especially by being  sexually suggestive oxford dictionaries nd common media has used this as an adjective to describe teenage sexting lohmann  roberts  what is sexting nude or risque pics sent by teens expose them to serious legal and social consequences  this research therefore defines risqu online behavior as behavior that is carried out in an online environment it is mostly indecent as in sexting flirting and scandalous behavior as in posting provocative images in an online environment risqu is indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy definition of risqu nd example risqu behavior includes flaming behavior which has been defined as

an offline environment and is mostly indecent as in flirting and scandalous behavior being sexually provocative or being offensive rude hostile in an offline environment this type of behavior has been extensively described in popular as well as academic literatures wilson and brazendale  conducted a study where they described appropriation of suggestive offline behavior by conducting an experiment that involved  using what they described as risqu slides of seaside postcards based largely on sexual innuendo to administer a humor test g d wilson brazendale  recently the wall street journal

policy and use common sense winkler r  another instance of offline suggestive behavior includes demeaning derogatory sexually suggestive behavior towards teachers in classroom oluwole   dangerous risky online behavior oxford dictionary defines risky as full of the possibility of danger failure or loss oxford dictionaries risky nd this research defines dangerous risky online behavior as

been discussed extensively in academic literature d arcy devaraj  vakharia  risky behavior includes engaging in all acts that are categorized as high risk sexual behavior risky behavior can also include acts of aggressions and violence that can include illegal acts involving gun fare and involving acts of substance use risky behavior can also include acts of domestic violence street fights

indicative of behavior that is rude with sexual connotations and bordering on indecency and indelicacy definition of risqu nd popular media have acknowledged and discussed facebook users risqu content posted on facebook for instance popular media word of mouth and social media marketing reported the computer babies post posted by intel which can be categorized as risqu content that went viral immediately indicating that users post risqu content to their facebook profile which allows them instant popularity h morris  other popular media have discussed whether risqu content should be allowed or not on facebook brown  facebook s porn cops  shapira nd however there is not much empirical study conducted on this wide observed behavior pattern of facebook users impression management thus assumes central position in this research because this work emphasizes the importance of shaping teenager personalities to become welladapted and productive citizens in future technological society impression management has been extensively researched in sociology and psychology disciplines  kr mer winter  the framework has been applied in various practical applications as public relations piwinger ebert  forensic literature perri lichtenwald  in the area of sports and psychology ginis lindwall prapavessis  and offline social behaviors like eating disordersherman roth polivy  facebook has also been researched extensively wilson et al   teenage behavior and gaming dill and dill  showed that there are factors that influence the relationship between video games and increased violence video games that harness the violenceappeal are built on instant gratification there is an instant reward or penalty for carrying out the violent act in a game for instance a kill segment will instantly gain the user with a jackpot reward or allow the user to continue to the next level here the gamer identifies with the character in the game in first person these emblematic aggressions impact the psychology of the player as the player controls the character of the game and therefore the player experiences the act of aggression as seen through the eyes of the character in the game dill dill  understanding the impact of video games on student s psyche is also important from the is discipline perspective  how is gaming relevant to information systems gaming is in many ways relevant to is and this study because this work recognizes a convergence of is user and gaming user requirements entertainment software association esa reported that of  million americans that played videogames   of the gamers are less than  years of age and an average of  hrs per week are spend playing with others online indicating that today s teenagers are heavily influenced by video games esa  according to walsh  research on absence of parental supervision reveals that such parents almost do not check the ratings of the videogames that are purchased by the children carnagey anderson  according to procons videogames sales statistics showed that the popular sales included many of the games that promotes carnal satiation of violence and narcissist genres charts graphs on video games youth violence  further research indicates that violent video games desensitize children at an early age to the effects of violence carnagey anderson bushman  research also indicates that it is possible for undeveloped minds of the children to get heavily influenced by these violent themes gunter  research further indicates this influence induced by the content of the violence in the games can lead to acts of violence and aggression sherry thus some of the impacts when parents do not supervise their children s offline behavior includes increased violent and aggressive behavior increased

personnel issues problems domain specific concepts information systems including group support systems organizational concepts strategies cultural implications societal concepts cultural implications ethical implications vessey et al  these topics can be linked to the topics studied under impression management im leary and kowalski  describe im to have consisted of topics such as goal relevance of impressions value of desired goals discrepancy between desired and current image impression construction construct of self desired and undesired identity images role constraints targets value and current or potential image it is concluded that impression management covers a wide spectrum of core research areas in information systems impression management can thus be seen to have a direct relevance to is research  groupware technology when technologies are designed in such a way that they serve the purpose of facilitating human interactions with the system rather than systems being used to solve some problems they are called groupware systems groupware is defined as computer based systems that supports groups of people engaged in a common task or goals and  that provide an interface to a shared environment ellis gibbs rein  christopherson  studied influences of anonymity in computermediated communication cmc and sia etal  study that looked at group polarization using groupware conferencing apparatus that utilized text based communications indicates that facebook is groupware technology  problem statement the usage of sns and the computer mediated communication media has been appropriated beyond its intended use this study concentrates on the psychological aspects of human information interactions by exploring how the student population adopts it and what factors influence the online behavior of students on social networking sites and in this way our paper represents a mainstream area of information science is research and contributes to the development of the discipline this study attempts to study the impression motivation which is the awareness that facebook is being used for uses other than the intended uses on the image construction which is the behavior exhibited through their online profile images the current research proposes to investigate balancing of the tradeoff between perceived privacy concerns and an active social media presence the proposed generalized research question of this dissertation is do active social media presence and various privacy concerns have any influence on student s online behaviors on social media this research will investigate this question in three different studies as following essay  investigates impression management theory as applied to social networking the growth of social networking sites in the last few years has changed the  pattern of its utility thereby providing yet another new social phenomenon essay  focus on the business implications by investigating the intention of recruiting managers to use social networking sites like facebook and myspace to conduct checks on prospective job candidates also school authorities and law enforcement have occasionally used facebook evidence for taking actions because they have been able to confirm or trace of criminal activities using the framework of impression management theory this study examines how online behavior of students is related to visibility awareness social networking site information trust and awareness of various features of technology essay  thus examines if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as visibility awareness and privacy concerns which is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave responsibly which is operationalized as responsible image on social media in essay  i extend essay  and fill in the research gap to investigate the negative impression management of students on facebook i focus on the risks associated with negative or risqu online behavior of students that can get mimicked to risky offline behaviors often leading to tragic results using the framework of impression management theory i examine how negative online behavior of students is related to students portraying different personalities by selectively disclosing their personas aided by awareness of various privacy features of technology essay  thus explores if factors such as dimension of active social media presence that is operationalized as selective disclosure and desired differential personas and privacy concerns that is operationalized as technology awareness influences students to behave negatively which is operationalized as negative or risqu image on social media  in essay  i extend the conceptual framework of essay  and look at trust and privacy of social networking while investigating factors influencing student behavior on facebook in the context of impression management with this study i aim to extend the previous studies by using the framework of trust in digital information to investigate privacy and security concerns related to the use of social networking this essay is still a work in progress and i am in the process of analyzing data essay  researches if factors such as dimensions of active social media presence such as impression motivation and information trustworthiness and privacy concerns operationalized as technology awareness influences students to have distinct impression management operationalized as image construction on social media my investigation shows that the impression management framework serves as the most important base model for predictors of social networking behaviors to increase the awareness of information and cyber security in order to promote the best security practices each essay has been built by reviewing the existing literature in social networking cyber security and information systems theories to increase the awareness of privacy and security concerns related with problematic use of the internet the research and the frameworks posited allow us to identify relevant concerns and directions for further research my work posits and supports new theory development and shows the overarching importance of researching privacy and security in social network analysis as a major organizational construct  research design the rest of this study is organized as below the next section describes  generalized literature review that discusses the periphery of the problem area the three research essays follow this each research essay is

4," 1  CHAPTER 1   INTRODUCTION  1.1 Introduction We are living in information-rich environments with rapidly transforming technology, different and enormous information sources, and highly specialized content. Such complex interaction does not guarantee that an individual will access the most consistent or relevant information and use it appropriately to work out problems. So when we are faced with complex problems, it is natural to work together with others to solve them more easily and effectively. Kuhlthau (1993) stated that the process of information search is not an isolated activity, and may be considered as a cooperative venture with peers or librarians as collaborators. In addition, collaborative approaches to research produce better and more efficient results than individual approaches in a variety of domains. Humans are social beings with a natural tendency toward collaboration, as seen in a growing body of evidence on collaborative efforts in today’s information-based society (Shah, 2010). This study examined students’ collaborative information seeking in a group-based learning environment.   1.2 Background Working with others within an organization can have a variety of positive effects, and the benefits of collaboration have been discussed in various areas. For example, in the workplace, collaborative workers benefit from the diverse contributions of members with different backgrounds, roles, attitudes and interests, all of whom contribute to the richness of the cooperative effort (Baeza-Yates & Pino, 2006). In a library and information science (LIS) study, 2  Talja (2002) identified the advantages of collaborative information seeking activities between academic scholars. She said that individuals in group projects seem to engage in more strategic and paradigmatic sharing. Thus, it would seem that group works offer individuals more potential for cooperative approaches to seeking and sharing information. In educational studies, many researchers also have emphasized the benefits of collaborative work with peers within the learning environment. For instance, Gokhale (1995) said that collaborative learning between peers promotes the active exchange of ideas and increases interest and critical thinking among students. Johnson and Johnson (1986) also emphasized that learners in collaborative groups are able to attain higher levels of attention and remember information longer than individual learners. In addition, with the knowledge shared in teams, students can participate in group discussions and take responsibility for their own learning as critical thinkers (Totten, Sills, Digby, & Russ, 1991). Moreover, collaboration can be a useful method for promoting learners’ knowledge construction (Schellens & Valcke, 2006).  The approaches of collaborative information behavior (CIB), collaborative information seeking behavior (CIS), and collaborative information retrieval (CIR) have been grounded in the research of information seeking behavior; therefore, they also have been focused on information behavior that involves human beings interacting with other humans. There are various meanings of collaboration in the activities of information seeking and retrieval in LIS studies. The term “CIS” is used interchangeably with terms such as CIB and CIR in many cases. In general, CIB includes people’s intricate process of activities to resolve their information needs (Talja & Hansen, 2006), and CIS means not only collaborative information seeking, but also sharing, understanding, and using information in collaboration (Paul & Reddy, 2010). Accordingly, the process of seeking, organizing, and using information has also been viewed as meaningful 3  collaboration. For example, Bruce, Fidel, Pejtersen, Dumais, and Grudin (2003) focused on situations where a group of people are seeking, searching, and using information collaboratively. They believed that information seeking is not always a solitary activity, and that people tend to work in collaborations for information-intensive tasks. Also, Morris (2008) found that most knowledge workers have the desire to search for information together in their workplace. In addition, they thought that CIS activities are essential for the success of their dynamic and specialized work tasks. Through CIS, people can identify their information problems or needs and solve their common goals.   As the amount of collaborative work being undertaken is growing in various fields, from the workplace to LIS and education, it is important that this topic area is studied by research based on collaborative practices to understand problems and suggest improvements. In LIS, the use of collaborative information seeking in a learning environment is expanding among students as a form of group research projects. In particular, collaboration in higher education has presented many advantages to the learning environment. Effective CIS in a learning environment allows for promoting students’ academic motivations, deeper understanding of the subject, and overall perceptions of success. Also, the facility of collaboration, such as a relatively safe setting, enables students’ development of the ability to collaborate in their group work (Meloche & Dalton, 2011). Despite the fact that a number of students have worked together on group projects and in collaboration and this has been shown to increase the learning and retention of information, instructors and academic librarians may have mostly overlooked the growing importance of collaborative activities in learning environments since there has been little research in this area.  4  1.3      Problem Statement In the learning environment, there have been some difficulties with collaborative activities among learners. One of the major difficulties with incorporating collaborative activities into learning environments may be controlling the relationship between the instructor and students. Panitz and Panitz (1998) found that current learning systems focused on encouraging competition and individual responsibility between students and discouraged interactions between students. However, collaborative activities in learning environments help to reestablish the relationship between students and instructors by offering a supportive environment, such as computer-supported communication tools. Curtis and Lawson (2001) explained that there are many different ways of interaction among students in collaborative learning, such as giving and receiving feedback or help, sharing knowledge, and exchanging resources and information, and that interaction play an important role in collaborative information seeking activities and learning. As a result of the interaction, such as peer sharing, review and correction, deeper learning may be able to occur within each member in collaborative information seeking activities and learning. However, some students may experience anxiety when interacting with peers and instructors during their learning as a team, while some students may feel isolation when they do not engage in any interaction in their collaborative learning.  In addition, collaborative learning is a student-centered process rather than instructor-centered, so students may need a deeper understanding of the subject they are learning in order to be able to engage in peer interaction.   1.4     Purpose of Study  This study was aimed at understanding graduate students’ collaborative information seeking and use throughout the process of a group project, what difficulties students experience   5  in each stage of the process and which factors affect the students’ experience in collaborative work, using the frameworks outlined in Yue and He’s CIB model, which describes the users’ information behaviors in collaboration, and Kuhlthaus’ information search process (ISP) model, which describes the users’ overall activities in the process of information seeking. The group assignment performed in this study was a curriculum-based research project to present students' understanding about a research topic.  The process of the research project was divided into three stages based on the Student Learning through Inquiry Measure (SLIM) toolkit developed by Todd, Kuhlthau, and Heinstrom (2005): initiation, mid-point, and completion.   Based on previous collaborative information studies, this study assumed that information seeking behavior in collaborative work is not just individual information seeking behavior; rather, it is embedded in other factors, such as context of tasks, cognitive aspects, and various social interactions. These factors may affect students’ information seeking activities, including seeking and using information, as well as the overall outcome of the problem-solving process. In addition, the information research process may be perceived differently by its performers or may be affected by the situations in which they are engaged.   In accord with Yue and He’s (2010) study, the focus of this study was on the relationships among participants’ information activities, perceptions of collaboration levels, types of support needed, and other factors (e.g., cognitive and social factors). The cognitive factors included students’ perceived knowledge of the research topic and perceived difficulty of the project. In addition, as a social factor, different degrees of familiarity with group members existed variously in each process of a collaborative work task in Yue and He’s CIB model, which may be related to students’ perceptions of collaboration levels in their group-based learning. Also, since this study was conducted within an embedded setting, certain background factors, such as student 6  demographics (i.e., degree program, gender) and previous experience in group work may influence their information seeking activities and perceptions of the collaborative activities.   1.5     Significance of Study This study was intended to make both theoretical and practical contributions to the literature. One aim related to the underlying theoretical models. The idea was to explain how group members seek and use information based on the ISP model (Kuhlthau, 2004) during three stages of the research project. In particular, this study explored several factors, including cognitive and social aspects that may be related to group members’ information seeking process, as well as perceptions of collaboration levels and types of supports needed from peers during the work task process. In addition, this study identified details of how group members manifest their information behavior and perceptions differently during each group task process. The CIB model (Yue & He, 2010) was selected because it explains interactions among collaboration levels, types of supports needed, stages of information activities, cognition, and task difficulty in collaborative information search tasks. The context of this study, students’ information seeking activities in a group-based research project, was different from contexts addressed by Yue and He. Therefore, the results of this study reflected application of CIS theory in an educational setting and helped validate the explanatory power of the model in a different context.  Another aim of this study was to provide practical support for collaborative activities in learning environments, especially in higher education. In order to better understand students' problems, practitioners would benefit from more deeply discussing how students actually seek and use information together and how they perceive their collaboration and interaction with 7  peers in group-based learning. Also, there may be some additional dimensions, including cognitive and social aspects, to consider with regard to group-based projects, since the factors can be significant criteria for students’ willingness and perceptions in collaborative learning. Therefore, a better understanding of collaborative learning could be helpful to instructors and academic librarians in designing effective collaborative course projects, information literacy systems, and library services.  1.6     Research Questions To understand collaborative information seeking by graduate students during their group project, this study explored the following research questions:             1.    In which ways do group members exhibit information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project? 1.1 How are the cognitive factors related to group members’ information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project? 1.2 How are the social factors related to group members’ information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project?             2.   In which ways do group members have different perceptions of collaboration levels throughout the group-based research project?  2.1  How are the cognitive factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels? 2.2 How are the social factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels?             3.   In what ways do group members require collaborations or supports from peers to solve their difficulties or problems throughout the group-based research project? 8  1.7     Research Approach According to previous CIB and CIS studies, various work tasks and social factors have been shown to influence students’ information behavior within their organization. Most of the research has, however, been conducted in limited contexts and settings. First, while a number of studies have been conducted on collaborative information behavior, the majority of them were in the area of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), not LIS (Prekop, 2002). Moreover, most of the previous CIB studies in the LIS field have focused mainly on the roles of group members or their perceptions of group work, and not on the behavior associated with group members’ information problem solving. Therefore, there is a need for a clearer understanding of collaboration in information seeking behavior, specifically in the field of LIS.  Second, even though several models of CIB have been investigated to explain CIS and information behavior, most of the studies have been analyzed by traditional information behavior models. Since most traditional models have been focused on individual behavior, those results cannot be fully applied to collaborative problem-solving in complex situations.  Third, many researchers have believed that information seeking behavior in learning environments is one of the most important factors affecting students’ learning, so they have applied this perspective to the study of CIS in educational contexts. Chung and Neuman (2007) considered that learning is one of the major goals of students’ information seeking, so its impact on learning must be reflected in various contexts and different learning tasks. Marchionini (1995) also stated that information seeking is related to learning and problem-solving because the goals of both are to change knowledge. As well, Neuman (2001) emphasized that it is necessary to 9  study students’ information seeking with a holistic view of their learning in an information-rich environment.  In the context of learning environments, although some studies have been focused on students’ information seeking behaviors (e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993; Limberg, 1999; Dodd, 2007; George et al., 2006), most of these studies have treated student’s learning and information seeking as  individual activities, not collaborative or group work. Recently, a few studies have been undertaken in the area of CIS focused on educational contexts (e.g., O’Farrell & Bates, 2009; Foster, 2009; Hyldegård, 2006, 2009) and interventions between peers throughout the group research process. However, there is little evidence of qualitative and empirical measures of CIS in learning environments, particularly in higher education.  Therefore, the design of the present study was based on both a traditional information behavior model focused on the individual level and a new CIB model focused on the group level. It investigated how graduate students performed information seeking activities and how they perceived degrees of collaboration and difficulty of the research project by undertaking both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The primary data collection methods were a behavior survey with closed- and open-ended items and content analyses of online communications.   1.8     Summary Working with others within a group can have various positive effects, and the advantages of collaboration have been discussed in a variety of areas. In LIS, the use of collaborative information seeking in a learning setting is increasing among students.  The purpose of this study was to understand graduate students’ collaborative information seeking and use through the process of a group project, what difficulties students experience in each stage of the process and which factors affect the students’ experience in collaborative work, 10  using the frameworks outlined in Yue and He’s CIB model, which describes the users’ information behaviors in collaboration and Kuhlthaus’ information search process (ISP) model, which describes the users’ overall activities in the process of information seeking.     ","1 chapter 1 introduction 1.1 introduction we are living in information-rich environments with rapidly transforming technology, different and enormous information sources, and highly specialized content. such complex interaction does not guarantee that an individual will access the most consistent or relevant information and use it appropriately to work out problems. so when we are faced with complex problems, it is natural to work together with others to solve them more easily and effectively. kuhlthau (1993) stated that the process of information search is not an isolated activity, and may be considered as a cooperative venture with peers or librarians as collaborators. in addition, collaborative approaches to research produce better and more efficient results than individual approaches in a variety of domains. humans are social beings with a natural tendency toward collaboration, as seen in a growing body of evidence on collaborative efforts in today’s information-based society (shah, 2010). this study examined students’ collaborative information seeking in a group-based learning environment. 1.2 background working with others within an organization can have a variety of positive effects, and the benefits of collaboration have been discussed in various areas. for example, in the workplace, collaborative workers benefit from the diverse contributions of members with different backgrounds, roles, attitudes and interests, all of whom contribute to the richness of the cooperative effort (baeza-yates & pino, 2006). in a library and information science (lis) study, 2 talja (2002) identified the advantages of collaborative information seeking activities between academic scholars. she said that individuals in group projects seem to engage in more strategic and paradigmatic sharing. thus, it would seem that group works offer individuals more potential for cooperative approaches to seeking and sharing information. in educational studies, many researchers also have emphasized the benefits of collaborative work with peers within the learning environment. for instance, gokhale (1995) said that collaborative learning between peers promotes the active exchange of ideas and increases interest and critical thinking among students. johnson and johnson (1986) also emphasized that learners in collaborative groups are able to attain higher levels of attention and remember information longer than individual learners. in addition, with the knowledge shared in teams, students can participate in group discussions and take responsibility for their own learning as critical thinkers (totten, sills, digby, & russ, 1991). moreover, collaboration can be a useful method for promoting learners’ knowledge construction (schellens & valcke, 2006). the approaches of collaborative information behavior (cib), collaborative information seeking behavior (cis), and collaborative information retrieval (cir) have been grounded in the research of information seeking behavior; therefore, they also have been focused on information behavior that involves human beings interacting with other humans. there are various meanings of collaboration in the activities of information seeking and retrieval in lis studies. the term “cis” is used interchangeably with terms such as cib and cir in many cases. in general, cib includes people’s intricate process of activities to resolve their information needs (talja & hansen, 2006), and cis means not only collaborative information seeking, but also sharing, understanding, and using information in collaboration (paul & reddy, 2010). accordingly, the process of seeking, organizing, and using information has also been viewed as meaningful 3 collaboration. for example, bruce, fidel, pejtersen, dumais, and grudin (2003) focused on situations where a group of people are seeking, searching, and using information collaboratively. they believed that information seeking is not always a solitary activity, and that people tend to work in collaborations for information-intensive tasks. also, morris (2008) found that most knowledge workers have the desire to search for information together in their workplace. in addition, they thought that cis activities are essential for the success of their dynamic and specialized work tasks. through cis, people can identify their information problems or needs and solve their common goals. as the amount of collaborative work being undertaken is growing in various fields, from the workplace to lis and education, it is important that this topic area is studied by research based on collaborative practices to understand problems and suggest improvements. in lis, the use of collaborative information seeking in a learning environment is expanding among students as a form of group research projects. in particular, collaboration in higher education has presented many advantages to the learning environment. effective cis in a learning environment allows for promoting students’ academic motivations, deeper understanding of the subject, and overall perceptions of success. also, the facility of collaboration, such as a relatively safe setting, enables students’ development of the ability to collaborate in their group work (meloche & dalton, 2011). despite the fact that a number of students have worked together on group projects and in collaboration and this has been shown to increase the learning and retention of information, instructors and academic librarians may have mostly overlooked the growing importance of collaborative activities in learning environments since there has been little research in this area. 4 1.3 problem statement in the learning environment, there have been some difficulties with collaborative activities among learners. one of the major difficulties with incorporating collaborative activities into learning environments may be controlling the relationship between the instructor and students. panitz and panitz (1998) found that current learning systems focused on encouraging competition and individual responsibility between students and discouraged interactions between students. however, collaborative activities in learning environments help to reestablish the relationship between students and instructors by offering a supportive environment, such as computer-supported communication tools. curtis and lawson (2001) explained that there are many different ways of interaction among students in collaborative learning, such as giving and receiving feedback or help, sharing knowledge, and exchanging resources and information, and that interaction play an important role in collaborative information seeking activities and learning. as a result of the interaction, such as peer sharing, review and correction, deeper learning may be able to occur within each member in collaborative information seeking activities and learning. however, some students may experience anxiety when interacting with peers and instructors during their learning as a team, while some students may feel isolation when they do not engage in any interaction in their collaborative learning. in addition, collaborative learning is a student-centered process rather than instructor-centered, so students may need a deeper understanding of the subject they are learning in order to be able to engage in peer interaction. 1.4 purpose of study this study was aimed at understanding graduate students’ collaborative information seeking and use throughout the process of a group project, what difficulties students experience 5 in each stage of the process and which factors affect the students’ experience in collaborative work, using the frameworks outlined in yue and he’s cib model, which describes the users’ information behaviors in collaboration, and kuhlthaus’ information search process (isp) model, which describes the users’ overall activities in the process of information seeking. the group assignment performed in this study was a curriculum-based research project to present students' understanding about a research topic. the process of the research project was divided into three stages based on the student learning through inquiry measure (slim) toolkit developed by todd, kuhlthau, and heinstrom (2005): initiation, mid-point, and completion. based on previous collaborative information studies, this study assumed that information seeking behavior in collaborative work is not just individual information seeking behavior; rather, it is embedded in other factors, such as context of tasks, cognitive aspects, and various social interactions. these factors may affect students’ information seeking activities, including seeking and using information, as well as the overall outcome of the problem-solving process. in addition, the information research process may be perceived differently by its performers or may be affected by the situations in which they are engaged. in accord with yue and he’s (2010) study, the focus of this study was on the relationships among participants’ information activities, perceptions of collaboration levels, types of support needed, and other factors (e.g., cognitive and social factors). the cognitive factors included students’ perceived knowledge of the research topic and perceived difficulty of the project. in addition, as a social factor, different degrees of familiarity with group members existed variously in each process of a collaborative work task in yue and he’s cib model, which may be related to students’ perceptions of collaboration levels in their group-based learning. also, since this study was conducted within an embedded setting, certain background factors, such as student 6 demographics (i.e., degree program, gender) and previous experience in group work may influence their information seeking activities and perceptions of the collaborative activities. 1.5 significance of study this study was intended to make both theoretical and practical contributions to the literature. one aim related to the underlying theoretical models. the idea was to explain how group members seek and use information based on the isp model (kuhlthau, 2004) during three stages of the research project. in particular, this study explored several factors, including cognitive and social aspects that may be related to group members’ information seeking process, as well as perceptions of collaboration levels and types of supports needed from peers during the work task process. in addition, this study identified details of how group members manifest their information behavior and perceptions differently during each group task process. the cib model (yue & he, 2010) was selected because it explains interactions among collaboration levels, types of supports needed, stages of information activities, cognition, and task difficulty in collaborative information search tasks. the context of this study, students’ information seeking activities in a group-based research project, was different from contexts addressed by yue and he. therefore, the results of this study reflected application of cis theory in an educational setting and helped validate the explanatory power of the model in a different context. another aim of this study was to provide practical support for collaborative activities in learning environments, especially in higher education. in order to better understand students' problems, practitioners would benefit from more deeply discussing how students actually seek and use information together and how they perceive their collaboration and interaction with 7 peers in group-based learning. also, there may be some additional dimensions, including cognitive and social aspects, to consider with regard to group-based projects, since the factors can be significant criteria for students’ willingness and perceptions in collaborative learning. therefore, a better understanding of collaborative learning could be helpful to instructors and academic librarians in designing effective collaborative course projects, information literacy systems, and library services. 1.6 research questions to understand collaborative information seeking by graduate students during their group project, this study explored the following research questions: 1. in which ways do group members exhibit information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project? 1.1 how are the cognitive factors related to group members’ information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project? 1.2 how are the social factors related to group members’ information seeking activities throughout the group-based research project? 2. in which ways do group members have different perceptions of collaboration levels throughout the group-based research project? 2.1 how are the cognitive factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels? 2.2 how are the social factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels? 3. in what ways do group members require collaborations or supports from peers to solve their difficulties or problems throughout the group-based research project? 8 1.7 research approach according to previous cib and cis studies, various work tasks and social factors have been shown to influence students’ information behavior within their organization. most of the research has, however, been conducted in limited contexts and settings. first, while a number of studies have been conducted on collaborative information behavior, the majority of them were in the area of computer-supported collaborative work (cscw), human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative learning (cscl), not lis (prekop, 2002). moreover, most of the previous cib studies in the lis field have focused mainly on the roles of group members or their perceptions of group work, and not on the behavior associated with group members’ information problem solving. therefore, there is a need for a clearer understanding of collaboration in information seeking behavior, specifically in the field of lis. second, even though several models of cib have been investigated to explain cis and information behavior, most of the studies have been analyzed by traditional information behavior models. since most traditional models have been focused on individual behavior, those results cannot be fully applied to collaborative problem-solving in complex situations. third, many researchers have believed that information seeking behavior in learning environments is one of the most important factors affecting students’ learning, so they have applied this perspective to the study of cis in educational contexts. chung and neuman (2007) considered that learning is one of the major goals of students’ information seeking, so its impact on learning must be reflected in various contexts and different learning tasks. marchionini (1995) also stated that information seeking is related to learning and problem-solving because the goals of both are to change knowledge. as well, neuman (2001) emphasized that it is necessary to 9 study students’ information seeking with a holistic view of their learning in an information-rich environment. in the context of learning environments, although some studies have been focused on students’ information seeking behaviors (e.g., kuhlthau, 1991, 1993; limberg, 1999; dodd, 2007; george et al., 2006), most of these studies have treated student’s learning and information seeking as individual activities, not collaborative or group work. recently, a few studies have been undertaken in the area of cis focused on educational contexts (e.g., o’farrell & bates, 2009; foster, 2009; hyldegård, 2006, 2009) and interventions between peers throughout the group research process. however, there is little evidence of qualitative and empirical measures of cis in learning environments, particularly in higher education. therefore, the design of the present study was based on both a traditional information behavior model focused on the individual level and a new cib model focused on the group level. it investigated how graduate students performed information seeking activities and how they perceived degrees of collaboration and difficulty of the research project by undertaking both quantitative and qualitative approaches. the primary data collection methods were a behavior survey with closed- and open-ended items and content analyses of online communications. 1.8 summary working with others

heinstrom 2005 initiation midpoint and completion based on previous collaborative information studies this study assumed that information seeking behavior in collaborative work is not just individual information seeking behavior rather it is embedded in other factors such as context of tasks cognitive aspects and various social interactions these factors may affect students information seeking activities including seeking and using information as well as the overall outcome of the problemsolving process in addition the information research process may be perceived differently by its performers or may be affected by the situations in which they are engaged in accord with yue and he s 2010 study the focus of this study was on the relationships among participants information activities perceptions of collaboration levels types of support needed and other factors eg cognitive and social factors the cognitive factors included students perceived knowledge of the research topic and perceived difficulty of the project in addition as a social factor different degrees of familiarity with group members existed variously in each process of a collaborative work task in yue and he s cib model which may be related to students perceptions of collaboration levels in their groupbased learning also since this study was conducted within an embedded setting certain background factors such as student 6 demographics ie degree program gender and previous experience in group work may influence their information seeking activities and perceptions of the collaborative activities 15 significance of study this study was intended to make both theoretical and practical contributions to the literature one aim related to the underlying theoretical models the idea was to explain how group members seek and use information based on the isp model kuhlthau 2004 during three stages of the research project in particular this study explored several factors including cognitive and social aspects that may be related to group members information seeking process as well as perceptions of collaboration levels and types of supports needed from peers during the work task process in addition this study identified details of how group members manifest their information behavior and perceptions differently during each group task process the cib model yue he 2010 was selected because it explains interactions among collaboration levels types of supports needed stages of information activities cognition and task difficulty in collaborative information search tasks the context of this study students information seeking activities in a groupbased research project was different from contexts addressed by yue and he therefore the results of this study reflected application of cis theory in an educational setting and helped validate the explanatory power of the model in a different context another aim of this study was to provide practical support for collaborative activities in learning environments especially in higher education in order to better understand students problems practitioners would benefit from more deeply discussing how students actually seek and use information together and how they perceive their collaboration and interaction with 7 peers in groupbased learning also there may be some additional dimensions including cognitive and social aspects to consider with regard to groupbased projects since the factors can be significant criteria for students willingness and perceptions in collaborative learning therefore a better understanding of collaborative learning could be helpful to instructors and academic librarians in designing effective collaborative course projects information literacy systems and library services 16 research questions to understand collaborative information seeking by graduate students during their group project this study explored the following research questions 1 in which ways do group members exhibit information seeking activities throughout the groupbased research project 11 how are the cognitive factors related to group members information seeking activities throughout the groupbased research project 12 how are the social factors related to group members information seeking activities throughout the groupbased research project 2 in which ways do group members have different perceptions of collaboration levels throughout the groupbased research project 21 how are the cognitive factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels 22 how are the social factors related to their perceptions of collaboration levels 3 in what ways do group members require collaborations or supports from peers to solve their difficulties or problems throughout the groupbased research project 8 17 research approach according to previous cib and cis studies various work tasks and social factors have been shown to influence students information behavior within their organization most of the research has however been conducted in limited contexts and settings first while a number of studies have been conducted on collaborative information behavior the majority of them were in the area of computersupported collaborative work cscw humancomputer interaction and computersupported collaborative learning cscl not lis prekop 2002 moreover most of the previous cib studies in the lis field have focused mainly on the roles of group members or their perceptions of group work and not on the behavior associated with group members information problem solving therefore there is a need for a clearer understanding of collaboration in information seeking behavior specifically in the field of lis second even though several models of cib have been investigated to explain cis and information behavior most of the studies have been analyzed by traditional information behavior models since most traditional models have been focused on individual behavior those results cannot be fully applied to collaborative problemsolving in complex situations third many researchers have believed that information seeking behavior in learning environments is one of the most important factors affecting students learning so they have applied this perspective to the study of cis in educational contexts chung and neuman 2007 considered that learning is one of the major goals of students information seeking so its impact on learning must be reflected in various contexts and different learning tasks marchionini 1995 also stated that information seeking is related to learning and problemsolving because the goals of both are to change knowledge as well neuman 2001 emphasized that it is necessary to 9 study students information seeking with a holistic view of their learning in an informationrich environment in the context of learning environments although some studies have been focused on students information seeking behaviors eg kuhlthau 1991 1993 limberg 1999 dodd 2007 george et al 2006 most of these studies have treated student s learning and information seeking as individual activities not collaborative or group work recently a few studies have been undertaken in the area of cis focused on educational contexts eg o farrell bates 2009 foster 2009 hyldeg rd 2006 2009 and interventions between peers throughout the group research process however there is little evidence of qualitative and empirical measures of cis in learning environments particularly in higher education therefore the design of the present study was based on both a traditional information behavior model focused on the individual level and a new cib model focused on the group level it investigated how graduate students performed information seeking activities and how they perceived degrees of collaboration and difficulty of the research project by undertaking both quantitative and qualitative approaches the primary data collection methods were a behavior survey with closed and openended items and content analyses of online communications 18 summary working with others within a group can have various positive effects and the advantages of collaboration have been discussed in a variety of areas in lis the use of collaborative information seeking in a learning setting is increasing among students the purpose of this study was to understand graduate students collaborative information seeking and use through the process of a group project what difficulties students experience in each stage of the process and which factors affect the students experience in collaborative work 10 using the frameworks outlined in yue and he s cib model which describes the users information behaviors in collaboration and kuhlthaus information search process isp model which describes the users overall activities in the process of information seeking, chapter  introduction  introduction we are living in informationrich environments with rapidly transforming technology different and enormous information sources and highly specialized content such complex interaction does not guarantee that an individual will access the most consistent or relevant information and use it appropriately to work out problems so when we are faced with complex problems it is natural to work together with others to solve them more easily and effectively kuhlthau  stated that the process of information search is not an isolated activity and may be considered as a cooperative venture with peers or librarians as collaborators in addition collaborative approaches to research produce better and more efficient results than individual approaches in a variety of domains humans are social beings with a natural tendency toward collaboration as seen in a growing body of evidence on collaborative efforts in today s informationbased society shah  this study examined students collaborative information seeking in a groupbased learning environment  background working with others within an organization can have a variety of positive effects and the benefits of collaboration have been discussed in various areas for example in the workplace collaborative workers benefit from the diverse contributions of members with different backgrounds roles attitudes and interests all of whom contribute to the richness of the cooperative effort baezayates pino  in a library and information science lis study  talja  identified the advantages of collaborative information seeking activities between academic scholars she said that individuals in group projects seem to engage in more strategic and paradigmatic sharing thus it would seem that group works offer individuals more potential for cooperative approaches to seeking and sharing information in educational studies many researchers also have emphasized the benefits of collaborative work with peers within the learning environment for instance gokhale  said that collaborative learning between peers promotes the active exchange of ideas and increases interest and critical thinking among students johnson and johnson  also emphasized that learners in collaborative groups are able to attain higher levels of attention and remember information longer than individual learners in addition with the knowledge shared in teams students can participate in group discussions and take responsibility for their own learning as critical thinkers totten sills digby russ  moreover collaboration can be a useful method for promoting learners knowledge construction schellens valcke  the approaches of collaborative information behavior cib collaborative information seeking behavior cis and collaborative information retrieval cir have been grounded in the research of information seeking behavior therefore they also have been focused on information behavior that involves human beings interacting with other humans there are various meanings of collaboration in the activities of information seeking and retrieval in lis studies the term cis is used interchangeably with terms such as cib and cir in many cases in general cib includes people s intricate process of activities to resolve their information needs talja hansen  and cis means not only collaborative information seeking but also sharing understanding and using information in collaboration paul reddy  accordingly the process of seeking organizing and using information has also been viewed as meaningful  collaboration for example bruce fidel pejtersen dumais and grudin  focused on situations where a group of people are seeking searching and using information collaboratively they believed that information seeking is not always a solitary activity and that people tend to work in collaborations for informationintensive tasks also morris  found that most knowledge workers have the desire to search for information together in their workplace in addition they thought that cis activities are essential for the success of their dynamic and specialized work tasks through cis people can identify their information problems or needs and solve their common goals as the amount of collaborative work being undertaken is growing in various fields from the workplace to lis and education it is important that this topic area is studied by research based on collaborative practices to understand problems and suggest improvements in lis the use of collaborative information seeking in a learning environment is expanding among students as a form of group research projects in particular collaboration in higher education has presented many advantages to the learning environment effective cis in a learning environment allows for promoting students academic motivations deeper understanding of the subject and overall perceptions of success also the facility of collaboration such as a relatively safe setting enables students development of the ability to collaborate in their group work meloche dalton  despite the fact that a number of students have worked together on group projects and in collaboration and this has been shown to increase the learning and retention of information instructors and academic librarians may have mostly overlooked the growing importance of collaborative activities in learning environments since there has been little research in this area   problem statement in the learning environment there have been some difficulties with collaborative activities among learners one of the major difficulties with incorporating collaborative activities into learning environments may be controlling the relationship between the instructor and students panitz and panitz  found that current learning systems focused on encouraging competition and individual responsibility between students and discouraged interactions between students however collaborative activities in learning environments help to reestablish the relationship between students and instructors by offering a supportive environment such as computersupported communication tools curtis and lawson  explained that there are many different ways of interaction among students in collaborative learning such as giving and receiving feedback or help sharing knowledge and exchanging resources and information and that interaction play an important role in collaborative information seeking activities and learning as a result of the interaction such as peer sharing review and correction deeper learning may be able to occur within each member in collaborative information seeking activities and learning however some students may experience anxiety when interacting with peers and instructors during their learning as a team while some students may feel isolation when they do not engage in any interaction in their collaborative learning in addition collaborative learning is a studentcentered process rather than instructorcentered so students may need a deeper understanding of the subject they are learning in order to be able to engage in peer interaction  purpose of study this study was aimed at understanding graduate students collaborative information seeking and use throughout the process of a group project what difficulties students experience  in each stage of the process and which factors affect the students experience in collaborative work using the frameworks outlined in yue and he s cib model which

learn environ help to reestablish the relationship between student and instructor by offer a support environ such a computersupport commun tool curti and lawson explain that there are mani differ way of interact among student in collabor learn such a give and receiv feedback or help share knowledg and exchang resourc and inform and that interact play an import role in collabor inform seek activ and learn a a result of the interact such a peer share review and correct deeper learn may be abl to occur within each member in collabor inform seek activ and learn howev some student may experi anxieti when interact with peer and instructor dure their learn a a team while some student may feel isol when they do not engag in ani interact in their collabor learn in addit collabor learn is a studentcent process rather than instructorcent so student may need a deeper understand of the subject they are learn in order to be abl to engag in peer interact purpos of studi thi studi wa aim at understand graduat student collabor inform seek and use throughout the process of a group project what difficulti student experi in each stage of the process and which factor affect the student experi in collabor work use the framework outlin in yue and he s cib model which describ the user inform behavior in collabor and kuhlthau inform search process isp model which describ the user overal activ in the process of inform seek the group assign perform in thi studi wa a curriculumbas research project to present student understand about a research topic the process of the research project wa divid into three stage base on the student learn through inquiri measur slim toolkit develop by todd kuhlthau and heinstrom initi midpoint and complet base on previou collabor inform studi thi studi assum that inform seek behavior in collabor work is not just individu inform seek behavior rather it is embed in other factor such a context of task cognit aspect and variou social interact these factor may affect student inform seek activ includ seek and use inform a well a the overal outcom of the problemsolv process in addit the inform research process may be perceiv differ by it perform or may be affect by the situat in which they are engag in accord with yue and he s studi the focu of thi studi wa on the relationship among particip inform activ percept of collabor level type of support need and other factor eg cognit and social factor the cognit factor includ student perceiv knowledg of the research topic and perceiv difficulti of the project in addit a a social factor differ degre of familiar with group member exist various in each process of a collabor work task in yue and he s cib model which may be relat to student percept of collabor level in their groupbas learn also sinc thi studi wa conduct within an embed set certain background factor such a student demograph ie degre program gender and previou experi in group work may influenc their inform seek activ and percept of the collabor activ signific of studi thi studi wa intend to make both theoret and practic contribut to the literatur one aim relat to the underli theoret model the idea wa to explain how group member seek and use inform base on the isp model kuhlthau dure three stage of the research project in particular thi studi explor sever factor includ cognit and social aspect that may be relat to group member inform seek process a well a percept of collabor level and type of support need from peer dure the work task process in addit thi studi identifi detail of how group member manifest their inform behavior and percept differ dure each group task process the cib model yue he wa select becaus it explain interact among collabor level type of support need stage of inform activ cognit and task difficulti in collabor inform search task the context of thi studi student inform seek activ in a groupbas research project wa differ from context address by yue and he therefor the result of thi studi reflect applic of ci theori in an educ set and help valid the explanatori power of the model in a differ context anoth aim of thi studi wa to provid practic support for collabor activ in learn environ especi in higher educ in order to better understand student problem practition would benefit from more deepli discus how student actual seek and use inform togeth and how they perceiv their collabor and interact with peer in groupbas learn also there may be some addit dimens includ cognit and social aspect to consid with regard to groupbas project sinc the factor can be signific criterion for student willing and percept in collabor learn therefor a better understand of collabor learn could be help to instructor and academ librarian in design effect collabor cours project inform literaci system and librari servic research question to understand collabor inform seek by graduat student dure their group project thi studi explor the follow research question in which way do group member exhibit inform seek activ throughout the groupbas research project how are the cognit factor relat to group member inform seek activ throughout the groupbas research project how are the social factor relat to group member inform seek activ throughout the groupbas research project in which way do group member have differ percept of collabor level throughout the groupbas research project how are the cognit factor relat to their percept of collabor level how are the social factor relat to their percept of collabor level in what way do group member requir collabor or support from peer to solv their difficulti or problem throughout the groupbas research project research approach accord to previou cib and ci studi variou work task and social factor have been shown to influenc student inform behavior within their organ most of the research ha howev been conduct in limit context and set first while a number of studi have been conduct on collabor inform behavior the major of them were in the area of computersupport collabor work cscw humancomput interact and computersupport collabor learn cscl not li prekop moreov most of the previou cib studi in the li field have focus mainli on the role of group member or their percept of group work and not on the behavior associ with group member inform problem solv therefor there is a need for a clearer understand of collabor in inform seek behavior specif in the field of li second even though sever model of cib have been investig to explain ci and inform behavior most of the studi have been analyz by tradit inform behavior model sinc most tradit model have been focus on individu behavior those result cannot be fulli appli to collabor problemsolv in complex situat third mani research have believ that inform seek behavior in learn environ is one of the most import factor affect student learn so they have appli thi perspect to the studi of ci in educ context chung and neuman consid that learn is one of the major goal of student inform seek so it impact on learn must be reflect in variou context and differ learn task marchionini also state that inform seek is relat to learn and problemsolv becaus the goal of both are to chang knowledg a well neuman emphas that it is necessari to studi student inform seek with a holist view of their learn in an informationrich environ in the context of learn environ although some studi have been focus on student inform seek behavior eg kuhlthau limberg dodd georg et al most of these studi have treat student s learn and inform seek a individu activ not collabor or group work recent a few studi have been undertaken in the area of ci focus on educ context eg o farrel bate foster hyldeg rd and intervent between peer throughout the group research process howev there is littl evid of qualit and empir measur of ci in learn environ particularli in higher educ therefor the design of the present studi wa base on both a tradit inform behavior model focus on the individu level and a new cib model focus on the group level it investig how graduat student perform inform seek activ and how they perceiv degre of collabor and difficulti of the research project by undertak both quantit and qualit approach the primari data collect method were a behavior survey with close and openend item and content analys of onlin commun summari work with other within a group can have variou posit effect and the advantag of collabor have been discus in a varieti of area in li the use of collabor inform seek in a learn set is increas among student the purpos of thi studi wa to understand graduat student collabor inform seek and use through the process of a group project what difficulti student experi in each stage of the process and which factor affect the student experi in collabor work use the framework outlin in yue and he s cib model which describ the user inform behavior in collabor and kuhlthau inform search process isp model which describ the

5,"CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTION AND RESEARCH QUESTION   The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.  H.D. Thoreau (1854)  Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?   T.S. Eliot (1934)   One sometimes imagines that most of life’s seemingly inexhaustible questions may be immediately if not adequately resolved in a static and linear fashion, from a precise question to a directly relevant answer, squarely on point.  It typically does not take much further excavation to realize, however, that many of life’s ponderous questions place more intense and deeper demands upon the mind which actively seeks out life’s answers and even one which more nonchalantly or haphazardly slides, glides, stumbles, and struggles through a morass of encountered information, whether in direct experience or in the guise of subconscious influences. Indeed, such is the case herein.  The genesis of the idea, which has gradually transformed over the course of decades if not my entire life, involved the Thoreauvian notion of “quiet desperation,” particularly in the professional mindset, and most specifically for lawyers.  But as often occurs—and indeed must transpire if an inquiry is to be taken seriously and deeply—that initial idea for the research question has inevitably and inexorably evolved, morphing as it were through the nuanced development of the question itself.  Hence, this analysis of the denial of relevance in the face of quiet desperation is deeply entwined with tracing a biography of questions, how we live with them, how they enmesh themselves into our brains and thus our  1 lives, how we deal with and address them, and ultimately the theoretical frameworks of how and what influences and guides us in further developing them.  In doing so, we may better understand our questions, our life choices, and ourselves, bringing information “to the point of use” to aid its dissemination and improve accomplishment or at least comprehension of our desires and dreams. The literature suggests that information seeking behaviors become more of a groping than hunting approach when dealing with broad, high-level decision-making on major (and often abstract) life choices.  Groping as used here is contrasted with a more directed or focused hunting, where in the former instance an information user feels in the dark or senses a fuzzy inclination toward an information need (O’Connor et al., 2003, 100, 146).  Information from today’s culture suggests that dissatisfaction with jobs, finances, and life in general, if not outright anxiety, exists which may impact those behaviors.  Information from philosophy and literature may help to better identify and address certain issues, and in combination with the academic literature, may intimate partial causes for behavioral dislocations as well as potential solutions for their resolution.  Thus, we may ask, can information ultimately help information users find the way back to life? As T.S. Eliot astutely observed, as quoted at the outset, people may be losing themselves in a morass of information and the issues to which it relates.  Yeats quoted Confucius, “How am I fallen from myself?” (Boyd, 2005).  Robert Bolt wrote of Sir Thomas More in a Man for All Seasons:  “When a man makes an oath, Meg, he’s holding his own self in his own hands.  Like water.  And if he opens his fingers—he needn’t hope to find himself again”  (Boyd, 1998, 77, 1999, 40).  In addition to “Life lost,” Eliot (1934) described the inevitable scenario every information user encounters at some point in one’s life:  “Footfalls echo in the memory, Down the passage which we did not take, Towards the door we never opened, into the rose-garden”  2 (117).  Thus, another way to pose the research question of this study may be stated:  Can information be used to increase the probabilities of reaching the “rose garden” of an information need?  More than 150 years ago, H.D. Thoreau (1854/1992) similarly asserted the inexorable condition of decision makers today:  “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation” (7).  Eliot and Thoreau are not alone in this perspective. Many notable literary scholars and poets also observed this characteristic in human nature that contributes to how and whether information users satisfy essential information needs—whether of the apathy and absence of alacrity, if not melancholy and despondency—when encountering the critical points at which life decisions are made:   • Rabindranath Tagore (1998), the first Indian Nobel laureate in 1913, poetically wrote, “The song I came to sing remains unsung.  I’ve spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument.”          • Joseph Campbell (1988) quoted the last line in Sinclair Lewis’s novel, “Babbit”:  “I have never done the thing that I wanted to do in all my life,” to which Campbell concluded, “That is a man who never followed his bliss.” (117).   • Robert Frost (1916) in The Road Not Taken, echoed the importance of the divergences encountered in life choices, “I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.”  And Frost etched the epitaph on his tombstone:  “I had a lover’s quarrel with the world.”  Lest one conclude these sentiments are decades or centuries old, there is very current recognition of the themes sounded by Thoreau that is being acknowledged by contemporary mainstream America.  Sanneh (2009, June 22) wrote in The New Yorker of a possible new trend beginning to catch on: Crawford’s book [Shop Class as Soulcraft] arrives just as a vague sense of dissatisfaction with the demands and rewards of the modern economy is coalescing into something like a movement. In 1998, the sociologist Richard Sennett published “The Corrosion of Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism,” in which he saw soul-destroying consequences in our new work habits – endless hours spent at flexible  3 jobs, performing abstract tasks on computer screens. Last year, in “The Craftsman,” Sennett suggested that skilled labor could be a way to resist corporate mediocrity. The environmentalist writer Bill McKibben proposed something similar in “Deep Economy,” which condemned the ruinous effects of endless economic expansion and urged readers to live smaller, simpler, more local lives…. These ideas have crept farther toward the mainstream in the wake of the economic collapse, which inspired calls for a return to real work – a return, in other words, to activities more tangible (and, it was hoped, less perilous) than complex swaps of abstract financial products. Crawford means his book to be a philosophical manifesto for a dawning age: an ode to old-fashioned hard work, and an argument that localism can help cure our spiritual and economic woes.    Similarly, Yoshino (2009, June 2) reported that the joblessness from the recent economic downturn engendered the opportunity to be “funemployed,” viewed as both cultural narcissism and backlash against corporate America by employees feeling that there is a lost balance between work and life and that “The rat race puts blinders on you and makes time fly.”  Dreher (2009, May 31) similarly wrote, “Many a white-collar man works hard but lives in a world of soul-killing abstraction, where what he does, what he feels and who he is have little to do with one another.”  Quoting Crawford, Dreher continued, “The work cannot sustain him as a human being. Rather, it damages the best part of him, and it becomes imperative to partition work off from the rest of life.”  Iyer (2009, June 28) wrote of his leaving a New York corporate job to live simply in a Japanese village because “I’m not sure how much outward details or accomplishments ever really make us happy deep down. The millionaires I know seem desperate to become multimillionaires and spend more time with their lawyers and bankers than with their friends (whose motivations they are no longer sure of).”  Rosemary Hill is another such example, who left a $200,000+ executive position in information systems, “re-evaluated her life [and] switched gears” because her priorities changed, so now she earns about $40,000 in her second career as a nurse in a cancer center (Roberson, 2009, January 25). The most recent data points of intense and urgent concern demonstrate the pertinent information gap(s):  4  • Time magazine recently reports: “Lawyers are committing suicide at an alarming rate” (2014, January 20).   CNN’s site inquires, “Why are lawyers killing themselves?” (Flores and Arce, 2014, January 20).  Since the CNN reporting, another study states that “depression is the main trigger for suicides and lawyers are 3.6 times more likely to suffer from it” (Karabin, 2014, April 7).  “According to the American Psychiatric Association and numerous other sources, depression is the most likely trigger for suicide.  Lawyers, as a group, are 3.6 times more likely to suffer from depression than the average person.  Of 104 occupations, lawyers were the most likely to suffer depression.” (Clarke, 2014, March 31).   •  “Further, according to a two-year study completed in 1997, suicide accounted for 10.8% of all deaths among lawyers in the United States and Canada and was the third leading cause of death.  Of more importance was the suicide rate among lawyers, which was 69.3 suicide deaths per 100,000 individuals, as compared to 10 to 14 suicide deaths per 100,000 individuals in the general population.  In short, the rate of death by suicide for lawyers was nearly six times the suicide rate in the general population” (Clarke, 2014, March 31).  These reports corroborate the prior article in the Vanderbilt Law Review with an extensive analysis of attorneys exhibiting high levels of suicide, depression, divorce, drug and alcohol abuse. (Schiltz, 1999, p. 871).   • Most recently, the American Bar Association Journal conveys survey results of over 6,000 lawyers, providing further corroboration of higher life dissatisfaction among lawyers at top-tier “prestige jobs” (Weiss, 2014, March 17).  “These data consistently indicate that a happy life as a lawyer is much less about grades, affluence, and prestige than about finding work that is interesting, engaging, personally meaningful, and is focused on providing needed help to others,” the authors conclude. “The data therefore also indicate that the tendency of law students and young lawyers to place prestige or financial concerns before their desires to ‘make a difference’ or serve the good of others will undermine their ongoing happiness in life.”   • U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (Brown, 2014, January 29) adduces evidence in the Wall Street Journal blog of another “true crisis:  the retirement picture for those currently age 45 to 64.  Three-quarters of Americans nearing retirement have less than $27,000 in their retirement accounts and one-third do not have any sort of retirement account at all.”  Further reported in the recent Yahoo Finance article, One-third of Americans only have $1,000 saved for retirement, “More Americans are confident about their retirement prospects for the first time in seven years, but even so, more than one-third of workers (36%) have a measly $1,000 saved for their later years, according to a new study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute” (Woodruff, 2014, March 18).  Corroborating the paucity of savings, Yahoo Finance also recently quoted one senior, “I’m never going to be able to retire.” (Yahoo, 2014, February 20).    • Former Director of the Office of Management and Budget, appointed by President Reagan, describes another looming financial crisis:  “[W]e are heading for $30 trillion—$35 trillion national debt [forecasted for the next ten 10 years].  It would take the system  5 down.  It would bankrupt the country.  We need to stop the buildup of this debt any further and actually pay it down….  Everyone’s spending every dime they can earn and every additional dime they can borrow.  We desperately need much higher productivity and investment in order to compensate for our very high wage cost and cost of living.  We therefore need to curtail consumption, change the basic equation so people are required to save, especially as the baby boom (retirement) continues to gather momentum.  You cannot think this economy will continue to work 10 years from now with 20 million more retirees, with all of the entitlements that need to be paid, if we don’t have a downshift in consumption.  That will cause the economy to go through a period of slow growth or even recession.  But we’ve been having a party for 30 years.  We’ve been living beyond our means.  The longer we wait to face up to the facts and the longer the politicians lie to the public and say you just need to go out to the mall and buy some more junk you don’t need, the greater is going to be the eventual day of reckoning.” (Stockman, D.A., 2014, March 2; VanBebber,  2006, December 22, 2006, November 6, 2007, August 12, 2008, January 20, 2010).   • As a result of such serious concerns, some writers question whether Americans will adapt to lower living standards.  In Tyler Cowen’s (2013) Average Is Over:  Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation, “Cowen says it will be tougher to get ahead in the future, for three reasons familiar to anybody who’s been paying attention to the shifting fortunes of U.S. workers,” of hiring selectivity and labor costs, international competition “for jobs at all levels,” and “replac[ing] people with technology” and automation (Newman, 2013, October 29).  “As uncomfortable as it may sound, there are plenty of ways for Americans to adjust to the Darwinian economy Cowen envisions.  They can move to cheaper, more affordable areas and use…other Internet innovations to telecommute….  Americans will also find new ways to eliminate a lot of waste, becoming thriftier in the process.” (Newman, 2013, October 29).   These poets and writers evoke the question:  What causes such “quiet desperation,” and what information may help clarify, resolve, or at least help us understand its relation to individual lives? Having identified the information need, Thoreau then implicitly, posed his own informational model (simplify, reduce financial encumbrances, attend to meaning and purpose (e.g., spirituality)), which is consistent with what contemporary scholars in information science and behavior analysis propose as a workable solution to resolving informational behavior problems in satisfying informational needs.   6 Wilson (1973, 1977) contended that whatever information solves a particular problem for an individual is relevant for that person in that situation.  O’Connor, Copeland, and Kearns (2003) posited that an abstract browsing approach for certain needs may occur, akin to hunting and gathering (which I recast here as groping, stumbling, staggering, shuffling), particularly in instances where an information need or question is ambiguous and/or otherwise difficult to articulate or reduce to specific terms and where the bereft information user is seemingly incapable of achieving clarity.  This is particularly the case involving off-the-grid and edge-of-the-grid queries, which are less amenable to an off-the-shelf or googled answer to a strictly circumscribed question.  O’Connor et al. present this scenario graphically by way of their MLO (Maron Levien O’Connor) matrix, in Appendix C and discussed herein, as a grid in which question states toward the lower-right edge risk fuzzy or unarticulated information needs. Case (2005) identified behaviors that can further impede the information-seeking process (or experience) involving cognitive dissonance and denial, thereby erecting obstacles to the resolution of information needs and gaps.  Wilson (1973, 1977) proposed a somewhat interactive approach to tutor or guide an information user to what is situationally relevant.   Gilbert (1978/1996) similarly asserted one means to accomplish such guidance by organizing information in such a way as to make it easier to understand and use.  Weaving these threads can lead toward a holistic and heuristic model (O’Connor, Copeland, & Kearns, 2003, pp. 95, 102, 113) for engaging the more abstract life choices and decision-making needs. Describing the emerging biography of the question uses various threads of multiple, disparate sources to weave a tapestry of a holistic model.  This model aids the information user in recognizing, identifying, clarifying, and otherwise better understanding a problem or potential problem. The use of different sources may aid the information professional in anticipating or  7 otherwise addressing the multiple unknown factors affecting receptivity of particular users. This stage of the process may contribute to the user in both recognizing and accepting that an anomalous information gap exists, and recognizing the causal components of the particular problem to that particular user.  Various sources are used to better understand both the problem as well as the possibility of an available and accessible solution to it, which may move a user to better decision-making.  This process of using multiple sources, of constructing information in simple ways amenable to the user’s easier understanding, and of guiding the user through the initial stages of the process of unrecognized or ambiguous needs, as well as unknown and unanticipatable receptivity factors affecting retrieval, may significantly aid an information user.  It may increase the probability of a user (1) identifying and accepting that an information gap exists; (2) being aided to better understand various aspects of that problem, including causal factors, intervening influences, and changing nuances; and (3) enabling the user to see and accept plausible solution(s).  This interactive guidance may not only accomplish these three objectives, but in part benefiting from such accomplishment, may also increase the probabilities that the user will choose action, appropriate action in the circumstances, in their decision-making process. Put simply, if a user faces various obstacles to problem-solving on a major life decision in the ongoing quest of question development, constructing an easy-to-understand case may persuade the user to see and solve their problem. For example, if one encounters the above quotations by Thoreau and Eliot, this information itself may awaken an anomalous state, which was latent but existent only in the interstices of consciousness and subconsciousness.  Depending on various constraints upon and obstacles facing the person-- including the capability to articulate specifically how and whether the encountering information is situationally relevant to that individual, the time to develop the thought and pursue the information gap, and the  8 awareness of the sources and types of information that may aid resolution-- the individual may evade, bypass, confuse, or even deny the anomalous gap.     9 ","chapter i introduction and research question the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. h.d. thoreau (1854) where is the life we have lost in living? where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? where is the knowledge we have lost in information? t.s. eliot (1934) one sometimes imagines that most of life’s seemingly inexhaustible questions may be immediately if not adequately resolved in a static and linear fashion, from a precise question to a directly relevant answer, squarely on point. it typically does not take much further excavation to realize, however, that many of life’s ponderous questions place more intense and deeper demands upon the mind which actively seeks out life’s answers and even one which more nonchalantly or haphazardly slides, glides, stumbles, and struggles through a morass of encountered information, whether in direct experience or in the guise of subconscious influences. indeed, such is the case herein. the genesis of the idea, which has gradually transformed over the course of decades if not my entire life, involved the thoreauvian notion of “quiet desperation,” particularly in the professional mindset, and most specifically for lawyers. but as often occurs—and indeed must transpire if an inquiry is to be taken seriously and deeply—that initial idea for the research question has inevitably and inexorably evolved, morphing as it were through the nuanced development of the question itself. hence, this analysis of the denial of relevance in the face of quiet desperation is deeply entwined with tracing a biography of questions, how we live with them, how they enmesh themselves into our brains and thus our 1 lives, how we deal with and address them, and ultimately the theoretical frameworks of how and what influences and guides us in further developing them. in doing so, we may better understand our questions, our life choices, and ourselves, bringing information “to the point of use” to aid its dissemination and improve accomplishment or at least comprehension of our desires and dreams. the literature suggests that information seeking behaviors become more of a groping than hunting approach when dealing with broad, high-level decision-making on major (and often abstract) life choices. groping as used here is contrasted with a more directed or focused hunting, where in the former instance an information user feels in the dark or senses a fuzzy inclination toward an information need (o’connor et al., 2003, 100, 146). information from today’s culture suggests that dissatisfaction with jobs, finances, and life in general, if not outright anxiety, exists which may impact those behaviors. information from philosophy and literature may help to better identify and address certain issues, and in combination with the academic literature, may intimate partial causes for behavioral dislocations as well as potential solutions for their resolution. thus, we may ask, can information ultimately help information users find the way back to life? as t.s. eliot astutely observed, as quoted at the outset, people may be losing themselves in a morass of information and the issues to which it relates. yeats quoted confucius, “how am i fallen from myself?” (boyd, 2005). robert bolt wrote of sir thomas more in a man for all seasons: “when a man makes an oath, meg, he’s holding his own self in his own hands. like water. and if he opens his fingers—he needn’t hope to find himself again” (boyd, 1998, 77, 1999, 40). in addition to “life lost,” eliot (1934) described the inevitable scenario every information user encounters at some point in one’s life: “footfalls echo in the memory, down the passage which we did not take, towards the door we never opened, into the rose-garden” 2 (117). thus, another way to pose the research question of this study may be stated: can information be used to increase the probabilities of reaching the “rose garden” of an information need? more than 150 years ago, h.d. thoreau (1854/1992) similarly asserted the inexorable condition of decision makers today: “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation” (7). eliot and thoreau are not alone in this perspective. many notable literary scholars and poets also observed this characteristic in human nature that contributes to how and whether information users satisfy essential information needs—whether of the apathy and absence of alacrity, if not melancholy and despondency—when encountering the critical points at which life decisions are made: • rabindranath tagore (1998), the first indian nobel laureate in 1913, poetically wrote, “the song i came to sing remains unsung. i’ve spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument.” • joseph campbell (1988) quoted the last line in sinclair lewis’s novel, “babbit”: “i have never done the thing that i wanted to do in all my life,” to which campbell concluded, “that is a man who never followed his bliss.” (117). • robert frost (1916) in the road not taken, echoed the importance of the divergences encountered in life choices, “i took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.” and frost etched the epitaph on his tombstone: “i had a lover’s quarrel with the world.” lest one conclude these sentiments are decades or centuries old, there is very current recognition of the themes sounded by thoreau that is being acknowledged by contemporary mainstream america. sanneh (2009, june 22) wrote in the new yorker of a possible new trend beginning to catch on: crawford’s book [shop class as soulcraft] arrives just as a vague sense of dissatisfaction with the demands and rewards of the modern economy is coalescing into something like a movement. in 1998, the sociologist richard sennett published “the corrosion of character: the personal consequences of work in the new capitalism,” in which he saw soul-destroying consequences in our new work habits –

mediocrity. the environmentalist writer bill mckibben proposed something similar in “deep economy,” which condemned the ruinous effects of endless economic expansion and urged readers to live smaller, simpler, more local lives…. these ideas have crept farther toward the mainstream in the wake of the economic collapse, which inspired calls for a return to real work – a return, in other words, to activities more tangible (and, it was hoped, less perilous) than complex swaps of abstract financial products. crawford means his book to be a philosophical manifesto for a dawning age: an ode to old-fashioned hard work, and an argument that localism can help cure our spiritual and economic woes. similarly, yoshino (2009, june 2) reported that the joblessness from the recent economic downturn engendered the opportunity to be “funemployed,” viewed as both cultural narcissism and backlash against corporate america by employees feeling that there is a lost balance between work and life and that “the rat race puts blinders on you and makes time fly.” dreher (2009, may 31) similarly wrote, “many a white-collar man works hard but lives in a world of soul-killing abstraction, where what he does, what he feels and who he is have little to do with one another.” quoting crawford, dreher continued, “the work cannot sustain him as a human being. rather, it damages the best part of him, and it becomes imperative to partition work off from the rest of life.” iyer (2009, june 28) wrote of his leaving a new york corporate job to live simply in a japanese village because “i’m not sure how

again” boyd 1998 77 1999 40 in addition to “life lost” eliot 1934 described the inevitable scenario every information user encounters at some point in one’s life “footfalls echo in the memory down the

how and whether information users satisfy essential information needs—whether of the apathy and absence of alacrity if not melancholy and despondency—when encountering the critical points at which life decisions are made • rabindranath tagore 1998 the first indian nobel laureate in 1913 poetically wrote “the song i came to sing remains unsung i’ve spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument” • joseph campbell 1988 quoted the last line in sinclair lewis’s novel “babbit” “i have never done the thing that i wanted to do in all my life” to which campbell concluded “that is a man who never followed his bliss” 117 • robert frost 1916 in the road not taken echoed the importance of the divergences encountered in life choices “i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference” and frost etched the epitaph on his tombstone “i had a lover’s quarrel with the world” lest one conclude these sentiments are decades or centuries old there is very current recognition of the themes sounded by thoreau that is being acknowledged by contemporary mainstream america sanneh 2009 june 22 wrote in the new yorker of a possible new trend beginning to catch on crawford’s book shop class as soulcraft arrives just as a vague sense of dissatisfaction with the demands and rewards of the modern economy is coalescing into something like a movement in 1998 the sociologist richard

writer bill mckibben proposed something similar in “deep economy” which condemned the ruinous effects of endless economic expansion and urged readers to live smaller simpler more local lives… these

anticipating or 7 otherwise addressing the multiple unknown factors affecting receptivity of particular users this stage of the process may contribute to the user in both recognizing and accepting that an anomalous information gap exists and recognizing the causal components of the particular problem to that particular user various sources are used to better understand both the problem as well

easytounderstand case may persuade the user to see and solve their problem for example if one encounters the above quotations by thoreau and eliot this information itself may awaken an anomalous state

old there is very current recognition of the themes sounded by thoreau that is being acknowledged by contemporary mainstream america sanneh  june  wrote in the new yorker of a possible new trend beginning to catch on crawford s book shop class as soulcraft arrives just as a vague sense of dissatisfaction with the demands and rewards of the modern economy is coalescing into something like a movement in  the sociologist richard sennett published the corrosion of character the personal consequences of work in the new capitalism in which he saw souldestroying consequences in our new work habits endless hours spent at flexible  jobs performing abstract tasks on computer screens last year in the craftsman sennett suggested that skilled labor could be a way to resist corporate mediocrity the environmentalist writer bill mckibben proposed something similar in deep economy which condemned the ruinous effects of endless economic expansion and urged readers to live smaller simpler more local lives these ideas have crept farther toward the mainstream in the wake of the economic collapse which inspired calls for a return to real work a return in other words to activities more tangible and it was hoped less perilous than complex swaps of abstract financial products crawford means his book to be a philosophical manifesto for a dawning age an ode to oldfashioned hard work and an argument that localism can help cure our spiritual and economic woes similarly yoshino  june  reported that the joblessness from the recent economic downturn engendered the opportunity to be funemployed viewed as both cultural narcissism and backlash against corporate america by employees feeling that there is a lost balance between work and life and that the rat race puts blinders on you and makes time fly dreher  may  similarly wrote many a whitecollar man works hard but lives in a world of soulkilling abstraction where what he does what he feels and who he is have little to do with

nurse in a cancer center roberson  january  the most recent data points of intense and urgent concern demonstrate the pertinent information gaps  time magazine recently reports lawyers are committing suicide at an alarming rate  january  cnn s site inquires why are lawyers killing themselves flores and arce  january  since the cnn reporting another study states that depression is the main trigger for suicides and lawyers are  times more likely to suffer from it karabin  april  according to the american psychiatric association and numerous other sources depression is the most likely trigger for suicide lawyers as a group are  times more likely to suffer from depression than the average person of  occupations lawyers were the most likely to suffer depression clarke  march  further according to a twoyear study completed in  suicide accounted for  of all deaths among lawyers in the united states and canada and was the third leading cause of death of more importance was the suicide rate among lawyers which was  suicide deaths per  individuals as compared to  to  suicide deaths per  individuals in the general population in short the rate of death by suicide for lawyers was nearly six times the suicide rate in the general population clarke  march  these reports corroborate the prior article in the vanderbilt law review with an extensive analysis of attorneys exhibiting high levels of suicide depression divorce drug and alcohol abuse schiltz  p  most recently the american bar association journal conveys survey results of over  lawyers providing further corroboration of higher life dissatisfaction among lawyers at toptier prestige jobs weiss  march  these data consistently indicate that a happy life as a lawyer is much less about grades affluence and prestige than about finding work that is interesting engaging personally meaningful and is focused on providing needed help to others the authors conclude the data therefore also indicate that the tendency of law students and young lawyers to place prestige or financial concerns before their desires to make a difference or serve the good of others will undermine their ongoing happiness in life us senator sherrod brown brown  january  adduces evidence in the wall street journal blog of another true crisis the retirement picture for those currently age  to  threequarters of americans nearing retirement have less than  in their retirement accounts and onethird do not have any sort of retirement account at all further reported in the recent yahoo finance article onethird of americans only have  saved for retirement more americans are confident about their retirement prospects for the first time in seven years but even so more than onethird of workers  have a measly  saved for their later years according to a new study by the employee benefit research institute woodruff  march  corroborating the paucity of savings yahoo finance also recently quoted one senior i m never going to be able to retire yahoo  february  former director of the office of management and budget appointed by president reagan describes another looming financial crisis we are heading for  trillion  trillion national debt forecasted for the next ten  years it would take the system  down it would bankrupt the country we need to stop the buildup of this debt any further and actually pay it down everyone s spending every dime they can earn and every additional dime they can borrow we desperately need much higher productivity and investment in order to compensate for our very high wage cost and cost of living we therefore need to curtail consumption change the basic equation so people are required to save especially as the baby boom retirement continues to gather momentum you cannot think this economy will continue to work  years from now with  million more retirees with all of the entitlements that need to be paid if we don t have a downshift in consumption that will cause the economy to go through a period of slow growth or even recession but we ve been having a party for  years we ve been living beyond our means the longer we wait to face up to the facts and the longer the politicians lie to the public and say you just need to go out to the mall and buy some more junk you don t need the greater is going to be the eventual day of reckoning stockman da  march  vanbebber  december   november   august   january   as a result of such serious concerns some writers question whether americans will adapt to lower living standards in tyler cowen s  average is over powering america beyond the age of the great stagnation cowen says it will be tougher to get ahead in the future for three reasons familiar to anybody who s been paying attention to the shifting fortunes of us workers of hiring selectivity and labor costs international competition for jobs at all levels and replacing people with technology and automation newman  october  as uncomfortable as it may sound there are plenty of ways for americans to adjust to the darwinian economy cowen envisions they can move to cheaper more affordable areas and use other internet innovations to telecommute americans will also find new ways to eliminate a lot of waste becoming thriftier in the process newman  october  these poets and writers evoke the question what causes such quiet desperation and what information may help clarify resolve or at least help us understand its relation to individual lives having identified the information need thoreau then implicitly posed his own informational model simplify reduce financial encumbrances attend to meaning and purpose eg spirituality which is consistent with what contemporary scholars in information science and behavior analysis propose as a workable solution to resolving informational behavior problems in satisfying informational needs  wilson   contended that whatever information solves a particular problem for an individual is relevant for that person in that situation o connor copeland and kearns  posited that an abstract browsing approach for certain needs may occur akin to hunting and gathering which i recast here as groping stumbling staggering shuffling particularly in instances where an information need or question is ambiguous andor otherwise difficult to articulate or reduce to specific terms and where the bereft information user is seemingly incapable of achieving clarity this is particularly the case involving offthegrid and edgeofthegrid queries which are less amenable to an offtheshelf or googled answer to a strictly circumscribed question o connor et al present this scenario graphically by way of their mlo maron levien o connor matrix in appendix c and discussed herein as a grid in which question states toward the lowerright edge risk fuzzy or unarticulated information needs case  identified behaviors that can further impede the informationseeking process or experience involving cognitive dissonance and denial thereby erecting obstacles to the resolution of information needs and gaps wilson   proposed a somewhat interactive approach to tutor or guide an information user to what is situationally relevant gilbert  similarly asserted one means to accomplish such guidance by organizing information in such a way as to make it easier to understand and use weaving these threads can lead toward a holistic and heuristic model o connor copeland kearns  pp    for engaging the more abstract life choices and decisionmaking needs describing the emerging biography of the question uses various threads of multiple disparate sources to weave a tapestry of a holistic model this model aids the information user in recognizing identifying clarifying and otherwise better understanding a problem or potential problem the use of different sources may aid the information professional in anticipating or  otherwise addressing the multiple unknown factors affecting receptivity of particular users this stage of the process may contribute to the user in both recognizing and accepting that an anomalous information gap exists and recognizing the causal components of the particular problem to that particular user various sources are used to better understand both the problem as well as the possibility of an available and accessible solution to it which may move a user to better decisionmaking this process of using multiple sources of constructing information in simple ways amenable to the user s easier understanding and of guiding the user through the initial stages of the process of unrecognized or ambiguous needs as well as unknown and unanticipatable receptivity factors affecting retrieval may significantly aid an information user it may increase the probability of a user  identifying and accepting that an information gap exists  being aided to better understand various aspects of that problem including causal factors intervening influences and changing nuances and  enabling the user to see and accept plausible solutions this interactive guidance may not only accomplish these three objectives but in part benefiting from such accomplishment may also increase the probabilities that the user will choose action appropriate action in the circumstances in their decisionmaking process put simply if a user faces various obstacles to problemsolving on a major life decision in the ongoing quest of question development constructing an easytounderstand case may persuade the user to see and solve their problem for example if one encounters the above quotations by thoreau and eliot this information itself may awaken an anomalous state which was latent but existent only in the interstices of consciousness and subconsciousness depending on various constraints upon and obstacles facing the person including the capability to articulate specifically how and whether the encountering information is situationally relevant to that individual the time to develop the thought and pursue the information gap and the  awareness of the sources and types of information that may aid resolution the individual may evade bypass confuse or even deny the anomalous gap

6,"1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Imagine an era when language developed in early humans and branched into multiple mutually unintelligible languages. In such an era, the likelihood of encountering a person who did not communicate with your language would have been low. Today, however, influenced by factors such as the printing press, mass communication, and digital technologies, the likelihood of encountering a person who does not understand your language is much higher.  Knowing the language of a message is of highest import in communication. Whether the message is spoken or written, without knowledge of which language is being used, little can be done with said message. Knowing the language of a digital message is similar, although semantic features may not play as big a role if they are not required for action to be taken on the message. For example, in information retrieval, or IR, correctly identifying a query's language is necessary for retrieving relevant documents, or documents in the query’s language. Knowing the language of a message is requisite to responding to the message or taking appropriate action with said message.  Of the 6-7 billion inhabitants of the earth, there are an estimated 6,909 languages used among them (http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/languages.htm (One World Nations Online). English has been and continues to be the dominant language online. However, this is changing. The emergence of online documents, including digital libraries, web pages and sites, blogs, news, etc., in languages other than English has grown exponentially in recent years. According to Internet World Stats, the rate of growth for the top ten most used languages on the Internet demonstrates a trend that, if it continues, will soon result in English losing its place as the 2 dominant language of the Internet. For example, the Chinese language has experienced an Internet growth of 1478.7% from 2000 to 2011, while English has experienced a significantly smaller Internet growth of only 301.4% (http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm).  This proliferation of various languages in the digital world led to the development of research areas such as multi-lingual information retrieval (MLIR) as well as, in part, machine translation (MT). It also served as an impetus to further research in language identification. Concerning MT, language identification is requisite to translation. See, for example, https://translate.google.com, in which Google lists an option to “Detect language” for source language input before translation. This implies the use of a language identification program to identify the language before meaningful translation can be reached. In cases in which a user did not know the source language, yet, nevertheless, desired a translation in a language that he or she could understand, language identification is essential. Of course, this excludes cases in which, as is another option, the user knows the language and can manually supply it to the translation engine. Problem Language plays a key role in many, perhaps even most, endeavors involving information. This is particularly true in cataloging and metadata generation. Many metadata schemas include a “language” element of the document or object that describes the metadata record. For example, in the MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) standards, in field 008 for books, which has 40 character positions, positions 35-37 are specifically used for language codes—a three letter code assigned to every known language. Consequently, English is represented by “eng,” French by “fre,” and German by “ger.” Professional catalogers for the Library of Congress, who 3 utilize MARC standards in their cataloging, are often highly specialized polyglots who collaborate among themselves if necessary for identifying a language of an object or dealing with any other difficulty that arises. Although cases may be rare in which a cataloger encounters problems that cannot be remedied easily through collaboration, these types of problems do occur (S. Miksa, personal communication, September 29, 2014).  What tools could a cataloger in a small, public library who used even the Dublin Core metadata schema utilize to identify the language of an object, digital or otherwise, if such a need arose? How would one who lacked linguistic specialization or a network of collaborative, polyglot peers go about identifying the particular language of an object for which he or she had no familiarity? This problem is clearly stated by Bade (2002) when he said that there are “too few catalogers in the country to do a greatly increasing load of publications in an increasing number of languages” (p. 10). It is a reasonable assumption that the title of an object is reflective of the contents of the same object, and since metadata is most often created in the language of the collection users, e.g., English, the elements other than the title, which may not be in English, is not considered for supplying an accurate value to the language element of a metadata record.  In 1994, Ted Dunning declared: “Given the following 20 character strings, e pruebas bioquimica man immunodeficiency faits se sont produi it is hardly surprising that a person can identify the languages as Spanish, English, and French, respectively” (p. 1). He further claims, based on this example, that language identification does not necessarily require language understanding, in that even a person who speaks no French or 4 Spanish can still determine these to be two of the languages in question of the third and first items. While this may very well be the case with a select few languages such as Dunning’s example above, consider the following example.  Given the following 20 character strings,  ca urmare publicarea   ezzel a magyar nyelv  sig inte som en egen would it be ”hardly” surprising for a person to recognize these strings as Romanian, Hungarian, and Swedish, respectively? I believe the answer is that it would be just the contrary—quite surprising for a person to accurately identify the three languages above. Just as in Dunning (1994), the above texts are selected to purposefully exclude any diacritical marks or special characters peculiar to the languages. Even so, consider how many persons with little or no knowledge of Romanian, Hungarian, and Swedish could accurately identify the above languages. The answer is very few, if any. In three cases, I present the three strings above to three separate acquaintances, and in every case, no single string is accurately identified. The fact is, the few persons who could accurately identify the above strings would likely be either polyglots or trained linguists.  With the aforementioned increase in languages present on the World Wide Web and in digital media, it is necessary, more than ever, to be able to accurately identify the languages of these texts in order to process them for any purpose, including obtaining accurate language identification for metadata records creation.  5 A recent project funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (www.imls.gov/), required a group of researchers, including me, to ascertain the language of two million metadata records as part of a plan to translate only English records into both Spanish and Chinese. For this purpose, I developed a language identification program to separate records determined to be English from records determined to be non-English. Experiments with open-source language identification programs proved to result in less accurate language identification than reached by the in-house program. Identifying the language of metadata records may be for one of two reasons. Firstly, supplying a value for metadata schema that contain a “language” element; and secondly, translation efforts, whether manual or by machine.  Now take a moment to consider the former reason above. Few multilingual digital collections have more than approximately five languages, and even fewer have polyglot staff members to identify languages or translate materials. The World Digital library, e.g., has a collection including contents in over 100 languages and a fully functional interface in seven languages (“About the World”, n.d.). Another multilingual digital collection is the International Children’s Digital Library, which includes 4619 books in 59 languages and a user interface available in five languages (“Library fast facts”, n.d.). However, most libraries and digital collections, as noted above, do not have a multilingual staff necessary for these types of collections.  Consider a public library in suburban Texas where a recent immigrant from Bulgaria has just moved to this suburban area and wishes to locate some readings in his or her mother tongue—Bulgarian. When the recent immigrant searches the collection for Bulgarian titles, with the help of a library staff member, only the metadata records which have an accurate value in the 6 language element will be returned by such a search. As mentioned above, the language element is not always present in metadata records. Let us say an estimated ten documents in the collection are in fact in Bulgarian, but only three of the ten have a Bulgarian value in the language element. Recall is a commonly used measure in information retrieval that refers to the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the number of relevant documents in a collection, or: rdcrdrR=where R is recall, rdr is relevant documents returned by a search, and rdc is relevant documents in collection. The recall value of the hypothetical search above for Bulgarian documents would then be .30, or 30%, which is quite low in terms of state-of-the-art information retrieval. The hypothetical Bulgarian user would then be incapable of using more than three of the ten Bulgarian documents present in the hypothetical collection, short of manually inspecting each title in the entire collection, or performing an exhaustive search.  This problem is indubitably occurring with a frequency correlated to the burgeoning of documents and digital materials in various languages from around the globe. This demonstrates a gap in effective search and retrieval in any digital collection, a gap in which users are incapable of retrieving relevant documents to a query consisting of the language of the content of desired documents.  Research question In light of the problem above, I answer the following question: Of the various approaches to automatic language identification, which one is most effective for the accurate language identification of metadata records, specifically, the title elements? 7 To answer this question, five approaches that are suited for language identification are implemented on a test collection for “effectiveness.” Effectiveness is measured by accuracy—the number of correctly identified samples/the number of total cases. Answering this question is requisite to determining and supplying an effective and automated method of language identification of metadata records for digital libraries wishing to improve their users’ language-related searches.  Significance of the study Language identification is used on a number of domains, but as of yet, has not been applied to title elements of metadata records. Accurate language identification becomes more difficult to achieve as the number of languages to be identified increase and as the length of the text segments to be identified shortens. For example, if the task is to determine whether a text belongs to one of two languages, e.g., Spanish or English, it is relatively easy, assuming one has sufficient data for training. The task increases in difficulty, however, if the texts to be identified belong to one of three, four, or even 50 or more languages (King, Radev, & Abney, 2014). Also, the length of the text affects the difficulty of language identification (Dunning, 1994). It is much easier to identify the language of a novel-length text than it is to identify the language of a single word or short phrase.  Metadata records embody both of these difficulties associated with language identification, i.e., they are often short segments of text and their language is limited only by the number of languages in the world today. Metadata records, especially the title element of such records, may be in any language of the world, whether the language is still alive and in use today or dead and no longer in use, e.g., Sanskrit. The number of possible languages that could appear in a 8 library collection is limited only by the number of languages extant on the planet today, whether the languages are thriving and in use or antiquated. The length of the title elements, of special import because the reasonable assumption can be made that the title of an object is most certainly reflective of the language of said object’s contents, is quite small. Knudson (2014), considering 800 metadata records from two different digital collections, found the title elements of the records to be an average length of 8.815 words. This illustrates the problem of accurately identifying the language of such elements, in that the shorter the text to be identified, the more difficult it is to accurately identify it. Also of note is the nature of titles, i.e., they are often incomplete, grammatical sentences, but are often comprised of phrases or even single words.  The growing prevalence of library, whether digital or print, objects in multiple languages result in what Bade (2002) calls linguistic errors in cataloging. These errors are due to the lack of linguistic training that modern catalogers receive. Most modern libraries invariably contain some objects that are in a language other than the language of the library. If and when metadata is generated for such objects, it would benefit users at all levels if the metadata were more exhaustive and thorough.  Language identification has been researched with short texts such as queries (Ceylan & Kim, 2009), news text (Cavnar & Trenkle, 1994), etc. However, language identification has not been applied to metadata records or their title elements, a fact that clearly indicates the significance of this study.  Consequently, I have devised a tool—an opeN-source language to identify the language of metadata records for digital libraries. I am making this tool available to digital libraries to 9 provide a more robust retrieval for language-based searches in their collections. The initial identifier uses 21 European languages, with future plans of extending the models to include more languages. This study provides the means for digital libraries to supply an accurate language element to the records in their collections. This, in turn, allows for better information retrieval by users wishing to find documents in a particular language. It also allows a more robust description of the collections’ objects. Users of said collections can then achieve more exhaustive results to queries based on the language of the content of desired objects. Limitations of the study The limitations of this study are: 1)The languages considered include only 21 European languages;2)The data used for training the language identifiers are mainly political in nature.The first of these limitations could easily be overcome by training the language identifiers to identify languages other than European languages. Expanding the dataset to include noN-European languages may greatly diminish this limitation. The specific domain of training data often restricts the test data to be of the same domain. For example, if trying to determine the language of online chatroom logs, the best training data for this task would be taken from chatrooms. The Europarl corpus, used for training in these experiments, is of a political domain. This study reduces this would-be domain limitation by implementing character-level N-gram language models rather than word-level. The approaches implemented have been proven and tried in the literature.  10 Definition of terminology Throughout the remainder of this thesis, certain concepts will be used which will be based on the following definitions:  Effectiveness—the score of a language identification approach. Effectiveness is the total number of correct classifications / the total number of considered items. It is measured in “accuracy.”  Language Identification—a form of text classification designed to determine to which language a particular text belongs. In this study, language identification strictly refers to textual language identification. Various approaches to language identification are commonly used and are discussed in a later section.  N-Gram—a sequence of 1-N tokens of text. These tokens may be characters, words, phrases, etc. Most uses of this term throughout refer to character N-grams, i.e., 1-N characters of text. Cases where tokens other than characters constitute the N-grams under discussion are explicitly stated.  Language Model (LM)—a statistical model comprised of sequences of tokens of text, often providing probabilities for the occurrence of the last token of an N-gram in light of previously occurring tokens.  N-Gram Frequency Profile—a profile built using a language sample. The profile consists of all character N-grams with N=1-5 sorted in descending order of occurrences within the language sample. This results in a list of highest to lowest occurring N-grams in the language sample, or training data (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).  11 Out-of-Place Measure—an ad hoc statistic computed by taking the difference between ranks of highest-occurring N-grams from a training N-gram frequency profile and a test N-gram frequency profile (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994). Distance Measure—a measure for determining how close a test text is to a particular language from training data. This should be done by comparing the N-gram frequency profile of the test text to the N-gram frequency profiles of the known languages developed in training. In this study, distance measure is calculated by summing the Out-of-Place Measures between the test N-gram frequency profile, and a training N-gram frequency profile. A distance measure is calculated for each language during training (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994). For example, in the training data for English and Spanish, the N-gram—“es” is the 16th and 22nd highest occurring N-gram, respectively. In a test string, the N-gram—“es” is the 4th highest occurring N-gram. This means that, for this particular N-gram—‘es’, the distance measure for English would be 16-4, or 2, and the distance measure for Spanish would be 22-4, or 8. Of course, as more N-grams were considered, the distance measures would be incremented by the new values, and the distance measure for each profile would be the sum of all out-of-place measures for each profile.  Research plan The purpose of this study is to experiment with different methods of language identification and determine the most suitable for digital libraries to use for identifying the language of metadata records, specifically, the title element. Five approaches, four of which have been tested and proven to be effective in the literature, are implemented, along with various sub-approaches using different-sized segments of language for modeling. These approaches are: An N-gram approach, a modified N-gram approach, a vector-space model approach, a naïve Bayes 12 approach, and an open-source approach. In the near future, the best of these approaches will be supplied to, and suggested for, use by digital libraries for identifying the language of their digital objects.  Summary This chapter presents a problem that exists in digital libraries and their collections, a problem related to poorer retrieval than is necessary if a language element easily obtained for objects within their collections. A solution to this problem is to provide an effective automatic language identifier to obtain an accurate value for supplying the language element of metadata records. Implementation by digital libraries of such an identifier would improve retrieval in cases where a user desires to retrieve objects whose contents are in a particular language.  The following pages contain a review of literature related to language identification and metadata records; the methods used for developing three language identification programs, each with varying numbers of approaches suitable for identifying the languages of metadata records; a pilot study which prompted this investigation; an analysis of the results of the approaches implemented; a comparison of these programs’ accuracies with the accuracy of an open-source language identification program, and a discussion.  ","1 chapter 1 introduction imagine an era when language developed in

in multiple languages result in what bade (2002) calls linguistic errors in cataloging. these errors are due to the lack of linguistic training that modern catalogers receive. most modern libraries invariably contain some objects that are in a language other than the language of the library. if and when metadata is generated for such objects, it would benefit users at all levels if the metadata were more exhaustive and thorough. language identification has been researched with short texts such as queries (ceylan & kim, 2009), news text (cavnar & trenkle, 1994), etc. however, language identification has not been applied to metadata records or their title elements, a fact that clearly indicates the significance of this study. consequently, i have devised a tool—an open-source language to identify the language of metadata records for digital libraries. i am making this tool available to digital libraries to 9 provide a more robust retrieval for language-based searches in their collections. the initial identifier uses 21 european languages, with future plans of extending the models to include more languages. this study provides the means for digital libraries to supply an accurate language element to the records in their collections. this, in turn, allows for better information retrieval by users wishing to find documents in a particular language. it also allows a more robust description of the collections’ objects. users of said collections can then achieve more exhaustive results to queries based on the language of the content of desired objects. limitations of the study the limitations of this study are: 1)the languages considered include only 21 european languages;2)the data used for training the language identifiers are mainly political in nature.the first of these limitations could easily be overcome by training the language identifiers to identify languages other than european languages. expanding the dataset to include non-european languages may greatly diminish this limitation. the specific domain of training data often restricts the test data to be of the same domain. for example, if trying to determine the language of online chatroom logs, the best training data for this task would be taken from chatrooms. the europarl corpus, used for training in these experiments, is of a political domain. this study reduces this would-be domain limitation by implementing character-level n-gram language models rather than word-level. the approaches implemented have been proven and tried in the literature. 10 definition of terminology throughout the remainder of this thesis, certain concepts will be used which will be based on the following definitions: effectiveness—the score of a language identification approach. effectiveness is the total number of correct classifications / the total number of considered items. it is measured in “accuracy.” language identification—a form of text classification designed to determine to which language a particular text belongs. in this study, language identification strictly refers to textual language identification. various approaches to language identification are commonly used and are discussed in a later section. n-gram—a sequence of 1-n tokens of text. these tokens may be characters, words, phrases, etc. most uses of this term throughout refer to character n-grams, i.e., 1-n characters of text. cases where tokens other than characters constitute the n-grams under discussion are explicitly stated. language model (lm)—a statistical model comprised of sequences of tokens of text, often providing probabilities for the occurrence of the last token of an n-gram in light of previously occurring tokens. n-gram frequency profile—a profile built using a language sample. the profile consists of all character n-grams with n=1-5 sorted in descending order of occurrences within the language sample. this results in a list of highest to lowest occurring n-grams in the language sample, or training data (cavnar and trenkle, 1994). 11 out-of-place measure—an ad hoc statistic computed by taking the difference between ranks of highest-occurring n-grams from a training n-gram frequency profile and a test n-gram frequency profile (cavnar and trenkle, 1994). distance measure—a measure for determining how close a test text is to a particular language from training data. this should be done by comparing the n-gram frequency profile of the test text to the n-gram frequency profiles of the known languages developed in training. in this study, distance measure is calculated by summing the out-of-place measures between the test n-gram frequency profile, and a training n-gram frequency profile. a distance measure is calculated for each language during training (cavnar and trenkle, 1994). for example, in the training data for english and spanish, the n-gram—“es” is the 16th and 22nd highest occurring n-gram, respectively. in a test string, the n-gram—“es” is the 4th highest occurring n-gram. this means that, for this particular n-gram—‘es’, the distance measure for english would be 16-4, or 2, and the distance measure for spanish would be 22-4, or 8. of course, as more n-grams were considered, the distance measures would be incremented by the new values, and the distance measure for each profile would be the sum of all out-of-place measures for each profile. research plan the purpose of this study is to experiment with different methods of language identification and determine the most suitable for digital libraries to use for identifying the language of metadata records, specifically, the title element. five approaches, four of which have been tested and proven to be effective in the literature, are implemented, along with various sub-approaches using different-sized segments of language for modeling. these approaches are: an n-gram approach, a modified n-gram approach, a vector-space model approach, a naïve bayes 12 approach, and an open-source approach. in the near future, the best of these approaches will be supplied to, and suggested for, use by digital libraries for identifying the language of their digital objects. summary this chapter presents a problem that exists in digital libraries and their collections, a problem related to poorer retrieval than is necessary if a language element easily obtained for objects within their collections. a solution to this problem is to provide an effective automatic language identifier to obtain an accurate value for supplying the language element of metadata records. implementation by digital libraries of such an identifier would improve retrieval in cases where a user desires to retrieve objects whose contents are in a particular language. the following pages contain a review of literature related to language identification and metadata records; the methods used for developing three language identification programs, each with varying numbers of approaches suitable for identifying the languages of metadata records; a pilot study which prompted this investigation; an analysis of the results of the approaches implemented; a comparison of these programs’ accuracies with the accuracy of an open-source language identification program, and a discussion.",1 chapter 1 introduction imagine an era when language developed in early humans and branched into multiple mutually unintelligible languages in such an era the likelihood of encountering a person who did not communicate with your language would have been low today however influenced by factors such as the printing press mass communication and digital technologies the likelihood of encountering a person who does not understand your language is much higher knowing the language of a message is of highest import in communication whether the message is spoken or written without knowledge of which language is being used little can be done with said message knowing the language of a digital message is similar although semantic features may not play as big a role if they are not required for action to be taken on the message for example in information retrieval or ir correctly identifying a querys language is necessary for retrieving relevant documents or documents in the query’s language knowing the language of a message is requisite to responding to the message or taking appropriate action with said message of the 67 billion inhabitants of the earth there are an estimated 6909 languages used among them httpwwwnationsonlineorgoneworldlanguageshtm one world nations online english has been and continues to be the dominant language online however this is changing the emergence of online documents including digital libraries web pages and sites blogs news etc in languages other than english has grown exponentially in recent years according to internet world stats the rate of growth for the top ten most used languages on the internet demonstrates a trend that if it continues will soon result in english losing its place as the 2 dominant language of the internet for example the chinese language has experienced an internet growth of 14787 from 2000 to 2011 while english has experienced a significantly smaller internet growth of only 3014 httpwwwinternetworldstatscomstats7htm this proliferation of various languages in the digital world led to the development of research areas such as multilingual information retrieval mlir as well as in part machine translation mt it also served as an impetus to further research in language identification concerning mt language identification is requisite to translation see for example httpstranslategooglecom in which google lists an option to “detect language” for source language input before translation this implies the use of a language identification program to identify the language before meaningful translation can be reached in cases in which a user did not know the source language yet nevertheless desired a translation in a language that he or she could understand language identification is essential of course this excludes cases in which as is another option the user knows the language and can manually supply it to the translation engine problem language plays a key role in many perhaps even most endeavors involving information this is particularly true in cataloging and metadata generation many metadata schemas include a “language” element of the document or object that describes the metadata record for example in the marc machinereadable cataloging standards in field 008 for books which has 40 character positions positions 3537 are specifically used for language codes—a three letter code assigned to every known language consequently english is represented by “eng” french by “fre” and german by “ger” professional catalogers for the library of congress who 3 utilize marc standards in their cataloging are often highly specialized polyglots who collaborate among themselves if necessary for identifying a language of an object or dealing with any other difficulty that arises although cases may be rare in which a cataloger encounters problems that cannot be remedied easily through collaboration these types of problems do occur s miksa personal communication september 29 2014 what tools could a cataloger in a small public library who used even the dublin core metadata schema utilize to identify the language of an object digital or otherwise if such a need arose how would one who lacked linguistic specialization or a network of collaborative polyglot peers go about identifying the particular language of an object for which he or she had no familiarity this problem is clearly stated by bade 2002 when he said that there are “too few catalogers in the country to do a greatly increasing load of publications in an increasing number of languages” p 10 it is a reasonable assumption that the title of an object is reflective of the contents of the same object and since metadata is most often created in the language of the collection users eg english the elements other than the title which may not be in english is not considered for supplying an accurate value to the language element of a metadata record in 1994 ted dunning declared “given the following 20 character strings e pruebas bioquimica man immunodeficiency faits se sont produi it is hardly surprising that a person can identify the languages as spanish english and french respectively” p 1 he further claims based on this example that language identification does not necessarily require language understanding in that even a person who speaks no french or 4 spanish can still determine these to be two of the languages in question of the third and first items while this may very well be the case with a select few languages such as dunning’s example above consider the following example given the following 20 character strings ca urmare publicarea ezzel a magyar nyelv sig inte som en egen would it be ”hardly” surprising for a person to recognize these strings as romanian hungarian and swedish respectively i believe the answer is that it would be just the contrary—quite surprising for a person to accurately identify the three languages above just as in dunning 1994 the above texts are selected to purposefully exclude any diacritical marks or special characters peculiar to the languages even so consider how many persons with little or no knowledge of romanian hungarian and swedish could accurately identify the above languages the answer is very few if any in three cases i present the three strings above to three separate acquaintances and in every case no single string is accurately identified the fact is the few persons who could accurately identify the above strings would likely be either polyglots or trained linguists with the aforementioned increase in languages present on the world wide web and in digital media it is necessary more than ever to be able to accurately identify the languages of these texts in order to process them for any purpose including obtaining accurate language identification for metadata records creation 5 a recent project funded by the institute of museum and library services imls wwwimlsgov required a group of researchers including me to ascertain the language of two million metadata records as part of a plan to translate only english records into both spanish and chinese for this purpose i developed a language identification program to separate records determined to be english from records determined to be nonenglish experiments with opensource language identification programs proved to result in less accurate language identification than reached by the inhouse program identifying the language of metadata records may be for one of two reasons firstly supplying a value for metadata schema that contain a “language” element and secondly translation efforts whether manual or by machine now take a moment to consider the former reason above few multilingual digital collections have more than approximately five languages and even fewer have polyglot staff members to identify languages or translate materials the world digital library eg has a collection including contents in over 100 languages and a fully functional interface in seven languages “about the world” nd another multilingual digital collection is the international children’s digital library which includes 4619 books in 59 languages and a user interface available in five languages “library fast facts” nd however most libraries and digital collections as noted above do not have a multilingual staff necessary for these types of collections consider a public library in suburban texas where a recent immigrant from bulgaria has just moved to this suburban area and wishes to locate some readings in his or her mother tongue—bulgarian when the recent immigrant searches the collection for bulgarian titles with the help of a library staff member only the metadata records which have an accurate value in the 6 language element will be returned by such a search as mentioned above the language element is not always present in metadata records let us say an estimated ten documents in the collection are in fact in bulgarian but only three of the ten have a bulgarian value in the language element recall is a commonly used measure in information retrieval that refers to the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the number of relevant documents in a collection or rdcrdrrwhere r is recall rdr is relevant documents returned by a search and rdc is relevant documents in collection the recall value of the hypothetical search above for bulgarian documents would then be 30 or 30 which is quite low in terms of stateoftheart information retrieval the hypothetical bulgarian user would then be incapable of using more than three of the ten bulgarian documents present in the hypothetical collection short of manually inspecting each title in the entire collection or performing an exhaustive search this problem is indubitably occurring with a frequency correlated to the burgeoning of documents and digital materials in various languages from around the globe this demonstrates a gap in effective search and retrieval in any digital collection a gap in which users are incapable of retrieving relevant documents to a query consisting of the language of the content of desired documents research question in light of the problem above i answer the following question of the various approaches to automatic language identification which one is most effective for the accurate language identification of metadata records specifically the title elements 7 to answer this question five approaches that are suited for language identification are implemented on a test collection for “effectiveness” effectiveness is measured by accuracy—the number of correctly identified samplesthe number of total cases answering this question is requisite to determining and supplying an effective and automated method of language identification of metadata records for digital libraries wishing to improve their users’ languagerelated searches significance of the study language identification is used on a number of domains but as of yet has not been applied to title elements of metadata records accurate language identification becomes more difficult to achieve as the number of languages to be identified increase and as the length of the text segments to be identified shortens for example if the task is to determine whether a text belongs to one of two languages eg spanish or english it is relatively easy assuming one has sufficient data for training the task increases in difficulty however if the texts to be identified belong to one of three four or even 50 or more languages king radev  abney 2014 also the length of the text affects the difficulty of language identification dunning 1994 it is much easier to identify the language of a novellength text than it is to identify the language of a single word or short phrase metadata records embody both of these difficulties associated with language identification ie they are often short segments of text and their language is limited only by the number of languages in the world today metadata records especially the title element of such records may be in any language of the world whether the language is still alive and in use today or dead and no longer in use eg sanskrit the number of possible languages that could appear in a 8 library collection is limited only by the number of languages extant on the planet today whether the languages are thriving and in use or antiquated the length of the title elements of special import because the reasonable assumption can be made that the title of an object is most certainly reflective of the language of said object’s contents is quite small knudson 2014 considering 800 metadata records from two different digital collections found the title elements of the records to be an average length of 8815 words this illustrates the problem of accurately identifying the language of such elements in that the shorter the text to be identified the more difficult it is to accurately identify it also of note is the nature of titles ie they are often incomplete grammatical sentences but are often comprised of phrases or even single words the growing prevalence of library whether digital or print objects in multiple languages result in what bade 2002 calls linguistic errors in

than european languages expanding the dataset to include noneuropean languages may greatly diminish this limitation the specific domain of training data often restricts the test data to be of the same domain for example if trying to determine the language of online chatroom logs the best training data for this task would be taken from chatrooms the europarl corpus used for training in these experiments is of a political domain this study reduces this wouldbe domain limitation by implementing characterlevel ngram language models rather than wordlevel the approaches implemented have been proven and tried in the literature 10 definition of terminology throughout the remainder of this thesis certain concepts will be used which will be based on the following definitions effectiveness the score of a language identification approach effectiveness is the total number of correct classifications the total number of considered items it is measured in accuracy language identification a form of text classification designed to determine to which language a particular text belongs in this study language identification strictly refers to textual language identification various approaches to language identification are commonly used and are discussed in a later section ngram a sequence of 1n tokens of text these tokens may be characters words phrases etc most uses of this term throughout refer to character ngrams ie 1n characters of text cases where tokens other than characters constitute the ngrams under discussion are explicitly stated language model lm a statistical model comprised of sequences of tokens of text often providing probabilities for the occurrence of the last token of an ngram in light of previously occurring tokens ngram frequency profile a profile built using a language sample the profile consists of all character ngrams with n15 sorted in descending order of occurrences within the language sample this results in a list of highest to lowest occurring ngrams in the language sample or training data cavnar and trenkle 1994 11 outofplace measure an ad hoc statistic computed by taking the difference between ranks of highestoccurring ngrams from a training ngram frequency profile and a test ngram frequency profile cavnar and trenkle 1994 distance measure a measure for determining how close a test text is to a particular language from training data this should be done by comparing the ngram frequency profile of the test text to the ngram frequency profiles of the known languages developed in training in this study distance measure is calculated by summing the outofplace measures between the test ngram frequency profile and a training ngram frequency profile a distance measure is calculated for each language during training cavnar and trenkle 1994 for example in the training data for english and spanish the ngram es is the 16th and 22nd highest occurring ngram respectively in a test string the ngram es is the 4th highest occurring ngram this means that for this particular ngram es the distance measure for english would be 164 or 2 and the distance measure for spanish would be 224 or 8 of course as more ngrams were considered the distance measures would be incremented by the new values and the distance measure for each profile would be the sum of all outofplace measures for each profile research plan the purpose of this study is to experiment with different methods of language identification and determine the most suitable for digital libraries to use for identifying the language of metadata records specifically the title element five approaches four of which have been tested and proven to be effective in the literature are implemented along with various subapproaches using differentsized segments of language for modeling these approaches are an ngram approach a modified ngram approach a vectorspace model approach a na ve bayes 12 approach and an opensource approach in the near future the best of these approaches will be supplied to and suggested for use by digital libraries for identifying the language of their digital objects summary this chapter presents a problem that exists in digital libraries and their collections a problem related to poorer retrieval than is necessary if a language element easily obtained for objects within their collections a solution to this problem is to provide an effective automatic language identifier to obtain an accurate value for supplying the language element of metadata records implementation by digital libraries of such an identifier would improve retrieval in cases where a user desires to retrieve objects whose contents are in a particular language the following pages contain a review of literature related to language identification and metadata records the methods used for developing three language identification programs each with varying numbers of approaches suitable for identifying the languages of metadata records a pilot study which prompted this investigation an analysis of the results of the approaches implemented a comparison of these programs accuracies with the accuracy of an opensource language identification program and a discussion, chapter  introduction imagine an era when language developed in early humans and branched into multiple mutually unintelligible languages in such an era the likelihood of encountering a person who did not communicate with your language would have been low today however influenced by factors such as the printing press mass communication and digital technologies the likelihood of encountering a person who does not understand your language is much higher knowing the language of a message is of highest import in communication whether the message is spoken or written without knowledge of which language is being used little can be done with said message knowing the language of a digital message is similar although semantic features may not play as big a role if they are not required for action to be taken on the message for example in information retrieval or ir correctly identifying a querys language is necessary for retrieving relevant documents or documents in the query s language knowing the language of a message is requisite to responding to the message or taking appropriate action with said message of the  billion inhabitants of the earth there are an estimated  languages used among them httpwwwnationsonlineorgoneworldlanguageshtm one world nations online english has been and continues to be the dominant language online however this is changing the emergence of online documents including digital libraries web pages and sites blogs news etc in languages other than english has grown exponentially in recent years according to internet world stats the rate of growth for the top ten most used languages on the internet demonstrates a trend that if it continues will soon result in english losing its place as the  dominant language of the internet for example the chinese language has experienced an internet growth of  from  to  while english has experienced a significantly smaller internet growth of only  httpwwwinternetworldstatscomstatshtm this proliferation of various languages in the digital world led to the development of research areas such as multilingual information retrieval mlir as well as in part machine translation mt it also served as an impetus to further research in language identification concerning mt language identification is requisite to translation see for example httpstranslategooglecom in which google lists an option to detect language for source language input before translation this implies the use of a language identification program to identify the language before meaningful translation can be reached in cases in which a user did not know the source language yet nevertheless desired a translation in a language that he or she could understand language identification is essential of course this excludes cases in which as is another option the user knows the language and can manually supply it to the translation engine problem language plays a key role in many perhaps even most endeavors involving information this is particularly true in cataloging and metadata generation many metadata schemas include a language element of the document or object that describes the metadata record for example in the marc machinereadable cataloging standards in field  for books which has  character positions positions  are specifically used for language codes a three letter code assigned to every known language consequently english is represented by eng french by fre and german by ger professional catalogers for the library of congress who  utilize marc standards in their cataloging are often highly specialized polyglots who collaborate among themselves if necessary for identifying a language of an object or dealing with any other difficulty that arises although cases may be rare in which a cataloger encounters problems that cannot be remedied easily through collaboration these types of problems do occur s miksa personal communication september   what tools could a cataloger in a small public library who used even the dublin core metadata schema utilize to identify the language of an object digital or otherwise if such a need arose how would one who lacked linguistic specialization or a network of collaborative polyglot peers go about identifying the particular language of an object for which he or she had no familiarity this problem is clearly stated by bade  when he said that there are too few catalogers in the country to do a greatly increasing load of publications in an increasing number of languages p  it is a reasonable assumption that the title of an object is reflective of the contents of the same object and since metadata is most often created in the language of the collection users eg english the elements other than the title which may not be in english is not considered for supplying an accurate value to the language element of a metadata record in  ted dunning declared given the following  character strings e pruebas bioquimica man immunodeficiency faits se sont produi it is hardly surprising that a person can identify the languages as spanish english and french respectively p  he further claims based on this example that language identification does not necessarily require language understanding in that even a person who speaks no french or  spanish can still determine these to be two of the languages in question of the third and first items while this may very well be the case with a select few languages such as dunning s example above consider the following example given the following  character strings ca urmare publicarea ezzel a magyar nyelv sig inte som en egen would it be hardly surprising for a person to recognize these strings as romanian hungarian and swedish respectively i believe the answer is that it would be just the contrary quite surprising for a person to accurately identify the three languages above just as in dunning  the above texts are selected to purposefully exclude any diacritical marks or special characters peculiar to the languages even so consider how many persons with little or no knowledge of romanian hungarian and swedish could accurately identify the above languages the answer is very few if any in three cases i present the three strings above to three separate acquaintances and in every case no single string is accurately identified the fact is the few persons who could accurately identify the above strings would likely be either polyglots or trained linguists with the aforementioned increase in languages present on the world wide web and in digital media it is necessary more than ever to be able to accurately identify the languages of these texts in order to process them for any purpose including obtaining accurate language identification for metadata records creation  a recent project funded by the institute of museum and library services imls wwwimlsgov required a group of researchers including me to ascertain the language of two million metadata records as part of a plan to translate only english records into both spanish and chinese for this purpose i developed a language identification program to separate records determined to be english from records determined to be nonenglish experiments with opensource language identification programs proved to result in less accurate language identification than reached by the inhouse program identifying the language of metadata records may be for one of two reasons firstly supplying a value for metadata schema that contain a language element and secondly translation efforts whether manual or by machine now take a moment to consider the former reason above few multilingual digital collections have more than approximately five languages and even fewer have polyglot staff members to identify languages or translate materials the world digital library eg has a collection including contents in over  languages and a fully functional interface in seven languages about the world nd another multilingual digital collection is the international children s digital library which includes  books in  languages and a user interface available in five languages library fast facts nd however most libraries and digital collections as noted above do not have a multilingual staff necessary for these types of collections consider a public library in suburban texas where a recent immigrant from bulgaria has just moved to this suburban area and wishes to locate some readings in his or her mother tongue bulgarian when the recent immigrant searches the collection for bulgarian titles with the help of a library staff member only the metadata records which have an accurate value in the  language element will be returned by such a search as mentioned above the language element is not always present in metadata records let us say an estimated ten documents in the collection are in fact in bulgarian but only three of the ten have a bulgarian value in the language element recall is a commonly used measure in information retrieval that refers to the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the number of relevant documents in a collection or rdcrdrrwhere r is recall rdr is relevant documents returned by a search and rdc is relevant documents in collection the recall value of the hypothetical search above for bulgarian documents would then be  or  which is quite low in terms of stateoftheart information retrieval the hypothetical bulgarian user would then be incapable of using more than three of the ten bulgarian documents present in the hypothetical collection short of manually inspecting each title in the entire collection or performing an exhaustive search this problem is indubitably occurring with a frequency correlated to the burgeoning of documents and digital materials in various languages from around the globe this demonstrates a gap in effective search and retrieval in any digital collection a gap in which users are incapable of retrieving relevant documents to a query consisting of the language of the content of desired documents research question in light of the problem above i answer the following question of the various approaches to automatic language identification which one is most effective for the accurate language identification of metadata records specifically the title elements  to answer this question five approaches that are suited for language identification are implemented on a test collection for effectiveness effectiveness is measured by accuracy the number of correctly identified samplesthe number of total cases answering this question is requisite to determining and supplying an effective and automated method of language identification of metadata records for digital libraries wishing to improve their users languagerelated searches significance of the study language identification is used on a number of domains but as of yet has not been applied to title elements of metadata records accurate language identification becomes more difficult to achieve as the number of languages to be identified increase and as the length of the text segments to be identified shortens for example if the task is to determine whether a text belongs to one of two languages eg spanish or english it is relatively easy assuming one has sufficient data for training the task increases in difficulty however if the texts to be identified belong to one of three four or even  or more languages king radev abney  also the length of the text affects the difficulty of language identification dunning  it is much easier to identify the language of a novellength text than it is to identify the language of a single word or short phrase metadata records embody both of these difficulties associated with language identification ie they are often short segments of text and their language is limited only by the number of languages in the world today metadata records especially the title element of such records may be in any language of the world whether the language is still alive and in use today or dead and no longer in use eg sanskrit the number of possible languages that could appear in a  library collection is limited only by the number of languages extant on the planet today whether the languages are thriving and in use or antiquated the length of the title elements of special import because the reasonable assumption can be made that the title of an object is most certainly reflective of the language of said object s contents is quite small knudson  considering  metadata records from two different digital collections found the title elements of the records to be an average length of  words this illustrates the problem of accurately identifying the language of such elements in that the shorter the text to be identified the more difficult it is to accurately identify it also of note is the nature of titles ie they are often incomplete grammatical sentences but are often comprised of phrases or even single words the growing prevalence of library whether digital or print objects in multiple languages result in what bade  calls linguistic errors in cataloging these errors are due to the lack of linguistic training that modern catalogers receive most modern libraries invariably contain some objects that are in a language other than the language of the library if and when metadata is generated for such objects it would benefit users at all levels if the metadata were more exhaustive and thorough language identification has been researched with short texts such as queries ceylan kim  news text cavnar trenkle  etc however language identification has not been applied to metadata records or their title elements a fact that clearly indicates the significance of this study consequently i have devised a tool an opensource language to identify the language of metadata records for digital libraries i am making this tool available to digital libraries to  provide a more robust retrieval for languagebased searches in their collections the initial identifier uses  european languages with future plans of extending the models to include more languages this study provides the means for digital libraries to supply an accurate language element to the records in their collections this in turn allows for better information retrieval by users wishing to find documents in a particular language it also allows a more robust description of the collections objects users of said collections can then achieve more exhaustive results to queries based on the language of the content of desired objects limitations of the study the limitations of

french by fre and german by ger profession catalog for the librari of congress who util marc standard in their catalog are often highli special polyglot who collabor among themselv if necessari for identifi a languag of an object or deal with ani other difficulti that aris although case may be rare in which a catalog encount problem that cannot be remedi easili through collabor these type of problem do occur s miksa person commun septemb what tool could a catalog in a small public librari who use even the dublin core metadata schema util to identifi the languag of an object digit or otherwis if such a need aros how would one who lack linguist special or a network of collabor polyglot peer go about identifi the particular languag of an object for which he or she had no familiar thi problem is clearli state by bade when he said that there are too few catalog in the countri to do a greatli increas load of public in an increas number of languag p it is a reason assumpt that the titl of an object is reflect of the content of the same object and sinc metadata is most often creat in the languag of the collect user eg english the element other than the titl which may not be in english is not consid for suppli an accur valu to the languag element of a metadata record in ted dun declar given the follow charact string e prueba bioquimica man immunodefici fait se sont produi it

in that even a person who speak no french or spanish can still determin these to be two of the languag in question of the third and first item while thi may veri well be the case with a select few languag such a dun s exampl abov consid the follow exampl given the follow charact string ca urmar publicarea ezzel a magyar nyelv sig int som en egen would it be hardli surpris for a person to recogn

abov text are select to purpos exclud ani diacrit mark or special charact peculiar to the languag even so consid how mani person with littl or no knowledg of romanian hungarian and swedish could accur identifi the abov languag the answer is veri few if ani in three case i present the three string abov to three separ acquaint and in everi case no singl string is accur identifi the fact is the few person who could accur identifi the abov string would like be either polyglot or train linguist with the aforement increas in languag present on the world wide web and in digit medium it is necessari more than ever to be abl to accur identifi the languag of these text in order to process them for ani purpos includ obtain accur languag identif for metadata record creation a recent project fund by the institut of museum and librari servic iml wwwimlsgov requir a group of research includ me to ascertain the languag of two million metadata record a part of a plan to translat onli english record into both spanish and chine for thi purpos i develop a languag identif program to separ record determin to be english from record determin to be nonenglish experi with opensourc languag identif program prove to result in le accur languag identif than reach by the inhous program identifi the languag of metadata record may be for one of two reason firstli suppli a valu for metadata schema that contain a languag element and secondli translat effort whether manual or by machin now take a moment to consid the former reason abov few multilingu digit collect have more than approxim five languag and even fewer have polyglot staff member to identifi languag or translat materi the world digit librari eg ha a collect includ content in over languag and a fulli function interfac in seven languag about the world nd anoth multilingu digit collect is the intern child s digit librari which includ book in languag and a user interfac avail in five languag librari fast fact nd howev most librari and digit collect a note abov do not have a multilingu staff necessari for these type of collect consid a public librari in suburban texa where a recent immigr from bulgaria ha just move to thi suburban area and wish to locat some read in hi or her mother tongu bulgarian when the recent immigr search the collect for bulgarian titl with the help of a librari staff member onli the metadata record which have an accur valu in the languag element will be return by such a search a mention abov the languag element is not alway present in metadata record let u say an estim ten document in the collect are in fact in bulgarian but onli three of the ten have a bulgarian valu in the languag element recal is a commonli use measur in inform retriev that refer to the number of relev document retriev by a search divid by the number of relev document in a collect or rdcrdrrwhere r is recal rdr is relev document return by a search and rdc is relev document in collect the recal valu of the hypothet search abov for bulgarian document would then be or which is quit low in term of stateoftheart inform retriev the hypothet bulgarian user would then be incap of use more than three of the ten bulgarian document present in the hypothet collect short of manual inspect each titl in the entir collect or perform an exhaust search thi problem is indubit occur with a frequenc correl to the burgeon of document and digit materi in variou languag from around the globe thi demonstr a gap in effect search and retriev in ani digit collect a gap in which user are incap of retriev relev document to a queri consist of the languag of the content of desir document research question in light of the problem abov i answer the follow question of the variou approach to automat languag identif which one is most effect for the accur languag identif of metadata record specif the titl element to answer thi question five approach that are suit for languag identif are implement on a test collect for effect effect is measur by accuraci the number of correctli identifi samplesth number of total case answer thi question is requisit to determin and suppli an effect and autom method of languag identif of metadata record for digit librari wish to improv their user languagerel search signific of the studi languag identif is use on a number of domain but a of yet ha not been appli to titl element of metadata record accur languag identif becom more difficult to achiev a the number of languag to be identifi increas and a the length of the text segment to be identifi shorten for exampl if the task is to determin whether a text belong to one of two languag eg spanish or english it is rel easi assum one ha suffici data for train the task increas in difficulti howev if the text to be identifi belong to one of three four or even or more languag king radev abney also the length of the text affect the difficulti of languag identif dun it is much easier to identifi the languag of a novellength text than it is to identifi the languag of a singl word or short phrase metadata record embodi both of these difficulti associ with languag identif ie they are often short segment of text and their languag is limit onli by the number of languag in the world today metadata record especi the titl element of such record may be in ani languag of the world whether the languag is still aliv and in use today or dead and no longer in use eg sanskrit the number of possibl languag that could appear in a librari collect is limit onli by the number of languag extant on the planet today whether the languag are thrive and in use or antiqu the length of the titl element of special import becaus the reason assumpt can be made that the titl of an object is most certainli reflect of the languag of said object s content is quit small knudson consid metadata record from two differ digit collect found the titl element of the record to be an averag length of word thi illustr the problem of accur identifi the languag of such element in that the shorter the text to be identifi the more difficult it is to accur identifi it also of note is the natur of titl ie they are often incomplet grammat sentenc but are often compris of phrase or even singl word the grow preval of librari whether digit or print object in multipl languag result in what bade call linguist error in catalog these error are due to the lack of linguist train that modern catalog receiv most modern librari invari contain some object that are in a languag other than the languag of the librari if and when metadata is gener for such object it would benefit user at all level if the metadata were more exhaust and thorough languag identif ha been research with short text such a queri ceylan kim news text cavnar trenkl etc howev languag identif ha not been appli to metadata record or their titl element a fact that clearli indic the signific of thi studi consequ i have devi a tool an opensourc languag to identifi the languag of metadata record for digit librari i am make thi tool avail to digit librari to provid a more robust retriev for languagebas search in their collect the initi identifi use european languag with futur plan of extend the model to includ more languag thi studi provid the mean for digit librari to suppli an accur languag element to the record in their collect thi in turn allow for better inform retriev by user wish to find document in a particular languag it also allow a more robust descript of the collect object user of said collect can then achiev more exhaust result to queri base on the languag of the content of desir object limit of the studi the limit of thi studi are the languag consid includ onli european languagesth data use for train the languag identifi are mainli polit in natureth first of these limit could easili be overcom by train the languag identifi to identifi languag other than european languag expand the dataset to includ noneuropean languag may greatli diminish thi limit the specif domain of train data often restrict the test data to be of the same domain for exampl if tri to determin the languag of onlin chatroom log the best train data for thi

7," 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Background The literature revealed that the number of Internet and social media users increases at a high rate due to advancements in information technology. Today, Internet users act as information seekers, generators, and distributors; thus, the Internet has become more dynamic, where its users collaborate to increase knowledge sharing. However, this makes the amount of human interaction immeasurable, and the volume of user-generated content hard to be both controlled and monitored. The high volume of information sharing could be a positive source of information when Internet communities collaborate to share valuable information. Unfortunately, the cyber sphere is an open environment that allows all types of people to access it and share diverse information; therefore, negative practices such as bullying, stalking, blackmailing, harassment, and other aggressive acts have been found in the digital world and form real threats for both adult and young users (Starcevic & Aboujaoude, 2015).  Advancements in technology create a new virtual life for people to communicate and share information without restrictions of time and location. These technological tools were designed to increase the level of social interaction between people everywhere, and to allow knowledge sharing that could be accessible to everyone and at any time. Social media applications have changed the way of communication, from face-to-face, screen-to-screen, or device-to-device communications. Although the technological revolution has increased the level of social interaction by sharing knowledge and valuable information, these technological tools could be used to benefit the community or harm its users (Shullich, 2011; Starcevic & Aboujaoude, 2015).   2 Social media users are able to create different media content, such as textual, visual, and video. People can publicly share their information or privately via private social groups. However, sharing information over the Internet and via social media networks is not totally protected from cyber risks. Recently, researchers revealed that traditional aggression could be transferred to the digital world and present similar or worse psychological impacts on victims (Dooley, Pyzalski & Cross, 2009; Ito et al., 2010; Zweig, Dank, Lachman, & Yahner, 2013). Researchers have investigated triggers, effects, and differences between traditional and digital aggression (O'Keeffe, Clarke-Pearson, & Council on Communications and Media, 2011). Wong-Lo and Bullock (2011) stated that digital aggression is a form of online peer aggression, which can be as damaging as any form of face-to-face aggression. Starcevic and Aboujaoude (2015) stated that as the usage of the Internet has increased, availability and speed of communication has also expanded. As a result of this, several new psychological disorders have been discovered, and many crimes are now more easily committed due to newfound digital aggression. Aboujaoude and Starcevic (2015) stated that with the increasing popularity of the Internet, it has been found that there are new and different mental health issues that have come to light. These issues can stem from cyber aggression, risks of overexposure to information, and the glorification of overtly sexual or violent acts (Aboujaoude & Starcevic, 2015).  The advancements of telecommunication technologies have increased the widespread use of social media applications. Nowadays, social media networks have billions of users and uncountable-shared media content, and they provide easy access to browse and share different content. Digital aggression is presented as a negative use of social media networks, especially when users post and share inappropriate content to harm others in public or private settings (Cook, Williams, Guerra, & Tuthill, 2007; Zweig, Dank, Lachman, & Yahner, 2013). Traditional  3 aggression acts, such as bullying and stalking, have been reconstructed in a digital manner, and names such as cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and online harassment have been used to describe these aggressive acts (Dooley, Pyzalski & Cross, 2009; Ito et al., 2010; Zweig, Dank, Lachman, & Yahner, 2013).  Today, cyber aggression is considered one of the digital dilemmas due to the high psychological and emotional risks generated by the uncontrolled aggressive practices, which can also lead to physical risks (Faryadi, 2011). These risks could cause both victims and perpetrators to experience depression, stress, anxiety, loneliness, low academic performance and productivity, eating disorders, and even suicide (Baldry & Winkel, 2003; Mills et al., 2004; Hinduja & Patchin, 2010). The literature provides many studies that could prove the effects of online aggression and how it could form serious threats; thus, many researchers recommend the use of education to spread awareness of these risks, as well as how to prevent and treat them effectively (Starcevic & Aboujaoude, 2015). Cyberbullying is mistakenly understood as conflicts among school students through the use of the Internet; however, the literature has shown that cyber aggressive acts could influence both adults and young people, including school students, college students, and coworkers (Al-Zahrani, 2015; Kowalski, Limber, & Agatston, 2012; Smith & Yoon, 2013). In one study, it was revealed that even adults could be at the risk of peer aggression: A strong association between workplace bullying and subsequent depression suggests that bullying is an etiological factor for mental health problems. The victims of bullying also seem to be at greater risk of cardiovascular disease. (Kivimaki et al., 2003, p.779)   4 These previous findings would make cyber aggression a global concern that should be taken seriously and not ignored, due to its destructive psychological, emotional, and medical effects on people from different ages, genders, and cultures.  Saudi Arabia is considered by some one of the fastest developing countries in the Middle East region. The Internet is provided at cheap rates and is available to everyone. Saudi citizens use the Internet for social interaction and sharing information on a daily basis. The use of smartphones is high due to the coverage of 3G and 4G networks in large cities and towns. The recent statistic analysis shows that there are around 20 million Internet users in Saudi Arabia, and 14 million active social media users (CITC, 2014; The Social Clinic, 2015). Cyber aggression is a new concept for many Saudi social media users, and most of them do not have a clear definition of it (see Pilot Study in Chapter 3).  The current literature presents two studies that investigated cyberbullying and cyberstalking concepts in Saudi Arabia. In one of these studies, the author stated that the findings come “in line with the current literature that consider cyberbullying as a global concern and can be a real risk to students and may cause them both emotional and physical harm” (Al-Zahrani, 2015, p.23). In this study, Al-Zahrani (2015) proved the prevalence of cyberbullying and its risk in Saudi Arabia and proved the existing of some online aggressive acts that could be consider cyberstalking. In the other study, the analysis of collected quantitative data from 500 Saudi participants indicated that more than 70% of the participants answered that they have never seen or heard about cyberbullying, and with this high percentage, Saudi Arabia ranked with the lowest awareness about cyber aggression among the selected 24 countries in the study (Ipsos Global Advisor, 2011).  5 Due to the lack of research in the literature about cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia, the researcher conducted a larger-scale pilot study to explore the concept of cyber aggression in social media applications. However, all selected participants were active social media users from Saudi Arabia. The study was designed to collect qualitative data throughout in-depth interviews with Saudi Arabian students at the University of North Texas (UNT).  The aim of the pilot study was to explore the concept of cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia as well as to understand the negative use of social media applications and the harmful information sharing practices. The transcription of the recoded interviews led to 450 pages that were analyzed by different categories of codes and themes. During the analysis process, the researcher focused on the factors that could be related to the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression. The pilot study concluded that cyber aggression and the inappropriate use and share of information were found due to lack of understanding, lack of support, and other cultural, traditional, and social aspects. Chapter 3 of this dissertation presents the pilot study, its methodology, data collection, analysis, and results. Purpose of the Study  This research was divided into two major stages. In the first stage, the main purpose was to understand cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia and how Saudi social media users perceive and tolerate the concept in their society. It was conducted to identify constructs and factors that could explain the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia and in different social media platforms with the goal of developing reliable scales. These were used at the second stage. Three scales: Cyberbullying Acceptance Scale, Cyberstalking Acceptance Scale, and Wrong Social Media Practices Acceptance Scale. A total of 71 items were generated from the  6 pilot study. Though using a sample from Saudi Arabia, acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression is thought to exist in other societies with similar cultural characteristics. In other this methodology may be generalized across similar cultures. The scales and items to measure them are discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of this dissertation. Research Problem  The literature shows a strong relationship between face-to-face and digital aggression and the generated physical and psychological harm that could affect people of all ages (Kowalski et al., 2012; Lange, 2007; Miller & Hufstedler, 2009; Olweus, 1993; Sabina, 2010; Whittaker & Kowalski, 2015). Past studies from different disciplines have focused on the causes and effects of aggression to prove its existence; however, there are no studies that developed scales with items to measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggressive acts in Saudi Arabia or in other parts of the world with similar cultural characteristics. In the following six sections, there is more deliberation of the cyber aggression dilemma related to the characteristics of Saudi Arabian culture. In Saudi Arabia, there is a lack of studies to describe digital aggression and its negative outcomes, particularly among the Saudi Arabian social media community. Al-Zahrani (2015) stated that cyberbullying has got much attention globally but “it has received little attention in developing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, especially from the education perspective. Thus, addressing the problem in Saudi Arabia is necessary and may inform the research context in this area” (p.18). After conducting the pilot study, the researcher found that the lack of understanding about how many acts and their effects were cyber aggressive, and the main reasons that could lead people to accept cyber aggression and behave aggressively (see Chapter 3).  7 The majority of participants stated that cyber aggression acts are very noticeable among Saudi social media users; however, they believe that people do not understand what is acceptable and not acceptable, and most of the problems are caused by information sharing practices. Furthermore, the lack of awareness and lack of immediate support were other factors that could increase the size of cyber aggression problem. It was concluded that the concept of cyber aggression is new for the majority of social media users in Saudi Arabia. People do not realize or understand the cyber aggression problems, they could not recognize the serious consequences on adults, adolescents, and children; thus, society members chose to accept or tolerate them not realizing the effects of aggressive acts. In 2010, the population of Saudi Arabia was 29.6 million, and the number is expected to be 35 million by 2020 (International Monetary Fund, 2015). More than 50% of the total population is under 25 years (Murphy, 2012). The last statistical report by the Communication and Information Technology Commission (CITC) indicates that the number of Internet users in Saudi Arabia is roughly 20 million (CITC, 2014). The old statistic by GlobalWebIndex (2012) indicates that there were around 9 million active social media users in Saudi Arabia. However, the number of social media users increased in recent years and reached around 14 million in early 2015 (The Social Clinic, 2015). In another report, it was found that the majority of Internet users in Saudi Arabia “spent 2.39 hours social networking and 1.45 hours microblogging daily, for a total of 3.84 hours of time spent online each day” (Winkels et al, 2013, p.28). This could stress the importance of social media applications in Saudi Arabia. Although the social media has changed human interactions, cyberbullying via social media was found in Saudi Arabia (Al-Zahrani, 2015).    8 Cyberbullying rate in Saudi Arabia has increased compared with Reuters global report in 2012, from 18% to about 27%. The increase in cyberbullying rate might indicate a serious prevailing problem and requires further action, despite the fact that these rates are still among the lowest rates globally. (Al-Zahrani, 2015, p.23)  Yet, cyber aggression is not well understood or documented in Saudi Arabia due to lack of studies in the literature, lack of education, and lack of understanding and awareness toward cyber aggression (Al-Zahrani, 2015; Ipsos Global Advisor, 2011; Pilot study in Chapter 3). The literature has proven the side effects of digital aggression and how it can lead victims to harmful psychological problems, mental illnesses, suicidal thoughts, and even suicide in severe cases (Baldry & Winkel, 2003; Mills et al., 2004; Hinduja & Patchin, 2010). Research findings have shown that people who become victims of cyber aggression face excessive stress in their life (Beebe, 2010). In Saudi Arabia, psychological problems are considered a type of stigma that should be hidden from society. At the same time, most of female patients cannot visit psychiatrists alone or without a guardian (Abdelwahid & Al-Shahrani, 2011; Al-Qadhi, Rahman, Farwana, & Imad Addin, 2014; Bassiony, 2005). In many cases, the victims and their families suffer without consultation or medical care because they do not want to reveal their problems.  Hiding problems would make these issues more problematic when compared to other cultures (the Western world, more developed countries, etc.) The victims may find themselves forced to hide their problems and harmful symptoms from close family members, friends, and society. Often this is because they do not want to be labeled with names that they consider shameful such as unstable, foolish, or mentally ill; at the same time, victims do not want their problems to become worse and affect their social standing (see Chapter 3). One study found that the rate of depression in Saudi Arabia has increased in recent years, and most general practitioners and medical doctors are not well prepared to diagnose depression;  9 therefore, it was recommended that the screening of  “depression should be implemented in primary care settings” (Al-Qadhi, Rahman, Farwana, & Imad Addin, 2014, p.7).  Another study found that the excessive use of social media and isolation led high school students in Riyadh to experience depression and high-level anxiety (Alnezi, 2014). However, the author of this study did not discuss if cyber aggression was one of the triggers to these psychological problems. None of the studies in the literature discussed the possible link between cyber aggression and psychological problems in Saudi Arabia. In Saudi society, mixing between genders is not accepted in public places, and women are required to be fully covered while they are in public to adhere to society values and traditions. Currently, the Internet is used as an important means for socializing. Sharing textual and visual information among different groups takes place despite the gender of users. At the same time, there is monitoring of social interactions on the Internet but it is impossible to have full control of those interactions; thus, the massive interaction between million of social media users in Saudi Arabia is thought to include cyber aggression. The increased level of interactions in today's social media applications, along with many diverse societal, cultural, and traditional aspects could influence the behaviors of social media users and may lead to cyber aggression justifications. It was found that men presented more aggression than women in Saudi Arabia, which may affect the safety of individuals in Saudi cyber sphere (Al-Zahrani, 2015). This could be attributed to the nature of Saudi Arabian society, given that it is a male dominated society (Al-Salem, 2005). In Saudi Arabia culture, males are perceived as guardians responsible for maintaining cultural and traditional values. Thus, the culturally biased gender differences could be a contributing factor in the increased cyber bullying by men toward women who use social media applications and may act out of the norms of  10 the society at large. There is a need to understand cyber aggression and the related factors that may affect the social media behaviors, acceptance, and tolerance toward the digital aggression. The literature and the pilot study revealed that the lack of understanding about legal consequences, the absent of law enforcement, and anonymity play a large role in increasing the level of online aggression among social media users (Akbulut & Eristi, 2011; Grigg, 2012; Pilot Study in Chapter 3). Cyberbullying and cyberstalking acts, such as spreading rumors, posting personal and sensitive information in public, or sharing humiliating videos or any information that could affect the social standing of the victim are regulated by the Anti-Cyber Crime Law. However, these laws are not well publicized in Saudi Arabia (Elnaim, 2013). Many people practice cyber aggressive acts without knowing the possible penalties, and most of them believe that their acts are not considered crimes. One of the participants from the pilot study was asked about the cyberbullying problems in Saudi Arabia, and he stated It’s a huge problem, and it's impacting people in a bad way, and we should have an immediate response to what's happening now, especially that we have people back home [Saudi Arabia] who are like addicted to social media, and they are not educated about the rules of social media [Cyber Crime Law]. (Appendix D: File_ [21674-22070], p. 221)   The pilot study revealed that aggression is very noticeable in social media applications; the high level of exposure affects people, and they learn many of the negative practices from their peers. In the absence of parent control the self-control, these aggressive acts become more acceptable and tolerable, and this could be related to certain social aspects. For example, Bandura (1978, 1986) in his Social Learning Theory and Aggression explained that people learn from their observed surroundings; thus, many aggressive behaviors can be learned from watching and imitating others. In social media, people could encounter aggression in their daily activities with friends and unknown people via social media.  11 Aggressive behavior is based on the learning, activation, and application of aggression-related knowledge structures stored in memory. Such learning takes place through encounters with the physical and social world. Much learning occurs through observing real and functional characters [or it may occur through online observation]. (Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007, p.491) 	  In the pilot study, participants affirmed the prevalence of cyber aggression, and they believed that people learn from each other and through online observations. The exposure to cyber aggression via social media applications on a daily basis could encourage cyber aggression acts; therefore, the researcher took these issues into carful consideration to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber aggression and all related factors. Importantly, measuring the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance would help in understanding the size of the cyber aggression problem and how the aggressive social interactions could impact social media users and spread the cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia. Problem Statement Although the literature has shown the existence of digital aggression and its physiological effects, measuring the acceptance of these aggressive acts via social media applications remains unexamined for the most part. Most of current scales in the literature are purposefully designed to study the occurrence of digital aggression, such as E-Victimisation Scale and E-Bullying Scale (Lam & Li, 2013), which were produced based on the Aggression and Victimization Scale by Orpinas and Horne (2010). However, these scales do not measure the acceptance of cyber aggression among social media users. A number of the studies proved the prevalence of digital aggression, the rates of its occurrence, and its effects on adults and youth people (Beran & Li, 2005; Beran & Li, 2008; DeHue, Bolman, & Vollink, 2008; Mishna, Khoury-Kassabri, Gadalla, & Daciuk, 2012). However, none of these studies investigated whether these online aggressive behaviors and acts might be socially accepted or tolerated, or their circumstances.  12 Significance of the Study Hanewald (2008) states that although cyber aggression was found to cause many psychological problems that could lead to physical violence and crimes and that the “educational community around the world has only made a small contribution” (p.2). The literature has presented the prevalence of digital aggression and its associated side effects; however, measuring the acceptance and tolerance of these online aggressive acts and hostile behaviors is still undiscovered. Measuring cyber aggression through the use of social media applications would help to expand our knowledge about cyber aggression and discuss it from a new perspective. In this study, cyber aggression was investigated in a different way by measuring how acceptable it is to bully or stalk someone in the digital world; at the same time, measuring how people tolerate different cyber aggressive acts. The literature lacks studies and descriptions about cyberbullying and cyberstalking in Saudi culture. There is a large demand to investigate the concept of cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia. Al-Zahrani (2015) concluded that “further research using different types of methodologies are required to address the problem and investigate the impacts of cyberbullying on students’ learning and social life” (p.24). Moreover, this study could provide a comprehensive understanding about the cyber aggression concept and new information to the literature about the Saudi digital culture. The study considered the dilemma of digital aggression and used the mixed methods approach by conducting a qualitative pilot study in its first stage and a quantitative approach in the second stage to create reliable and valid scales that can measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression, including the acceptance of wrong practices of sharing aggressive information and media via social media applications. The literature revealed that  13 aggression in the cyber sphere could lead to face-to-face aggression, physical harm, and violence. Thus, measuring cyber aggression would help in understanding the size of problem, providing proper help and support, and preventing possible future incidents and crimes.  Understanding the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance could inform researchers, educators, parents, and even managers in workplaces about the rate of cyber aggression and help in designing required educational programs to raise the level of awareness and providing the required support and help resources.  Research Questions The pilot study included a qualitative approach to collect descriptive data through a number of interviews with selected participants. The researcher used open-ended questions to explore the cyber aggression phenomena expansively. The researcher arranged the interview questions in six sections (see Appendix C).  The researcher used, then, a survey of social media users in Saudi Arabia. As stated previously, the purpose of this research is to develop an instrument that could measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of online aggressive practices as well as measuring the negative use and share of information via social media applications to answer the following research questions: Q1. What factors could explain cyber aggression via social media applications in Saudi Arabia? Q2. To what extent do social media users in Saudi Arabia accept and tolerate cyber aggression? Q3. To what extent do information-sharing practices affect social media users in Saudi Arabia?   14 Limitations of the Study  This study focused on the phenomenon of cyber aggression, the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggressive acts. Data were collected of mainly Saudi Arabian social media users. The researcher selected Saudi Arabian students who live in the Dallas/Fort worth area to participate in the initial interviews (pilot study). Therefore, they were in the United States and were more aware of the cyber aggression concept from their personal contacts or their children’s schools. The interviews revealed that the participants had heard about cyber aggression and strongly believed that people in Saudi Arabia would not be familiar with the concept because Saudi society ignores it and there is no interest in schools or TV media to increase general awareness of this type of aggression among the general society. The pilot study cannot affirm that people in Saudi Arabia have never heard about cyber aggression.  Another related issue is that the researcher conducted the exploratory pilot study to collect the participants’ understandings and meanings of cyber aggression; nevertheless, the researcher used a small sample size of Saudi students (14 participants) who live in the United States. This is a limitation that could affect the items in the scales because the researcher has assumptions based on the views of people who live outside Saudi Arabia and had the chance to understand the concepts of cyber aggression. These scales were developed based on participants’ understanding of the concept of cyber aggression, and it is predictable that Saudi social media users who live in Saudi Arabia and have never heard about cyber aggression would have different understandings and meanings of this concept.  The designed scales were developed based on the analysis of collected qualitative data via the interviews with Saudi social media users, thus, the scales’ items would be suitable to measure cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia and in other countries with similar cultural views.  15 Notably, what is acceptable or tolerable in the some cultures may be an unsuitable act in the Saudi culture. There is a need for some modifications on these developed scales to make them reliable and valid across all cultures, though generalization may be possible across others that are similar. The pilot study provided a comprehensive picture of cyber aggression in Saudi Arabia and then the researcher focused on examining the reliability of scales and tried to increase their reliability values by removing irrelevant items. There is a need for more studies to test these developed scales and increase their reliability and examine them with larger different samples.   Definition of Terms This section provides a table at the end defines the different terms in this dissertation. It is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation of main terms related to the cyber aggression and developed scales. There is also a need to understand the meaning of acceptability and tolerability because the literature shows that people refuse to accept negative acts and they hide them or find another name to justify their actions (Spaniol & Gagne, 1997).  Terms of Cyber Aggression Cyberbullying is the conscious, deliberate, repeated and hostile behavior by one or more people who intend to harm others via the use of technology (Hinduja & Patchin, 2014). For example, calling disrespectful names, sending unwanted messages, spreading rumors, posting humiliating information, or spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings.  Cyberstalking is a course of online conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear (Hanewald, 2008). For examples, sending aggressive massages,  16 posting false information, and spreading nasty rumors or defamations that all jeopardize victims’ social status, personal and professional relationships, reputation, and future.  Wrong social media practices include the unsafe use of social media applications by sharing personal information and sensitive information, ignoring privacy settings, spreading false information, ignoring cyber policies, etc. However, personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information; thus, it is a multi-dimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity. Personal pictures, private videos, family issues, health issues, finical issues, future plans, and secrets could be personal and sensitive information. Acceptability and Tolerability Spaniol and Gagne (1997) defined acceptance as a process that “involves both emotional as well as cognitive aspects of ourselves. It is not simply a matter of making a decision. It involves working out this decision emotionally and through our actions” (p.75). They added that acceptance means “seeing and acknowledging all the various aspects of oneself without devaluing oneself” (p.75). In this vine, people may practice aggression without recognizing it as a harmful act that could lead to that type of negative acceptance. Spaniol and Gagne (1997) stated that acceptance “means seeing ourselves as we are, without judging ourselves” (p.76). It could denote that people may do what they do without thinking or judging their acts, whether they harm others or not. It was mentioned that acceptance needs support from others, because supporting the act would make it acceptable to many people in society, and this acceptance would lead to more acceptance for both those who do the act as well as those who observe it (Anthony, 1993; Spaniol & Gagne, 1997). This type of support could play a role in expanding the size of acceptability. Spaniol and Gagne (1997) stated that the process of acceptance is “ [a] process  17 with people and events. We are not alone in how we experience and respond to our life” (p.76). Spreading acceptance to members of society is complex because it is “a process that may take a long time. It involves all of us, our mind, our body, our emotions, and our behavior” (Spaniol & Gagne, 1997, p.77). It was declared that acceptance is a process that would make a person accept an act without devaluing it, and this acceptance could happen at one's own discretion without any force. At the same time, a person may deal with the act without accepting it; in other words, a person may tolerate the act without totally accepting it or rejecting it.  From a psychology perspective, tolerance is defined as “a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry” (Fish, 2014, para.3). The pilot study revealed that some participants would not accept the practice of cyber aggression but they would tolerate it. Participants were able to justify cyber aggression while at the same time they would object the justification. A number of participants in the pilot study believed that social media users in Saudi Arabia may act aggressively but they may not realize that their acts are aggressive when the society ignores these acts. Fatany (2013) stated that most of bullying cases in schools are ignored, and this could be an alarming sign that, when these acts are not considered important, people may try to accept or justify and tolerate them.  To differentiate between acceptance and tolerance, Fish (2014) stated that acceptance is “a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit” (Fish, 2014, para.4). On the other hand, tolerating does not necessarily mean accepting, because tolerance “is only possible when some action or practice is objectionable to us, but we have  18 overriding reasons to allow that action or practice to take place” (Powell & Clarke, 2013, p.3). They added that when “we decide to tolerate an action or a practice, we decide to forego an opportunity to interfere in some instance of that activity or practice” (Powell & Clarke, 2013, p.3). This means that people may tolerate cyber aggressive acts for some reasons without accepting them, or they may accept actions without seeing any objection to refuse them. Acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance. If a sign of tolerance is a feeling of ‘I can live with X (behavior, religion, race, culture, etc.)’ acceptance moves beyond that in the direction of ‘X is OK.’ You can tolerate something without accepting it, but you cannot accept something without tolerating it. For example, when a son or daughter tells a parent about an unwelcome career choice, marital partner, or sexual identity, he or she wants that information not just to be tolerated, but to be accepted. (Fish, 2014, para.6)  In this dissertation, the term acceptance was used to determine whether social media users in Saudi Arabia accept cyber aggression, or if they may tolerate it under certain circumstances. The pilot study revealed that participants have a level of toleration towards cyber aggression due to a number of factors (see Chapter 3). It is logical that accepting cyber aggression could be more severe than tolerating it, however, tolerating cyber aggression does not make it less harmful than accepting it. When problems are ignored or left without solutions they may lead to severe psychological and emotional damages, as well as a high crime rate (Alamri, 2015; Fatany, 2013).  The following table provides definitions for the most significant terms used in this dissertation. It is critical to define these terms in advance in order to create a proper literature review about the selected topic in this research.    19 Table 1  Definition of Terms Terms Definitions Cyber Aggression Any aggressive acts carried out by individuals or groups, using electronic technology, that occur repeatedly against victims who cannot defend themselves. The offenses will be prevalent over the Internet to reach an unlimited number of people in fast time (Slonje & Smith, 2008). Cyberbullying Willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices (Hinduja & Patchin, 2014). Harm includes calling disrespectful names, sending unwanted messages, spreading rumors, posting humiliating information, and spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings. Cyberstalking A form of pressure that occurs by monitoring a person’s activities via the Internet and social media and invading his or her privacy by unwanted contact with targets or revealing personal or sensitive information that would cause fear and discomfort (Hanewald, 2008). Information Sensitivity Any personal information that should be kept away from public access. However, personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information; thus, it is multi-dimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity. Examples are personal pictures, private videos, family issues, health issues, finical issues, future plans, secrets, etc. Social Media Networks Electronic communication tools (like Internet websites or applications for social networking and blogging) where users are the main creator and distributor for the shared information among online communities.   20 Terms Definitions User-Generated Content Content that holds different types of information created by social media users to share thoughts, ideas, personal opinions, news, public events, or through sending regular texts, pictures, and videos. Facebook An online social networking service that allows the sharing of textual, pictorial, and audio-visual information privately or publicly.  Twitter An online social networking service that enables users to send and read short 140 character messages called “tweets,"" which are viewable to all public users. Twitter Hashtag A hashtag symbol (#) is used before a relevant keyword, phrase, or event with no spaces in tweets to categorize them with words that can be easily reached and shared. Instagram A social media application that runs on smartphones and tablets. It allows for textual, visual, and limited video streaming sharing up to 15 seconds, and makes them viewable to public or private users. YouTube An online social networking service that allows users to create personal channels and upload short or long videos for public viewing and the sharing of knowledge. Interacting by commenting and ranking on shared contents is possible for all users. Social Media Comments A textual participation via social media applications to share opinions about information, videos, or pictures. WhatsApp An application run on smartphones and tablets using the Internet connection that allows users to share information, pictures, and videos via private groups in one-to-one or one to many communications.  21 Terms Definitions Smartphone A cell phone with the capabilities of a mobile personal computer and a regular cellular phone. Photoshopped Images A technique of changing a picture by adding effects like colors, brushes, or layers in a way to change the original sense of it. Public Sharing A shared for information that is viewable and available to public audience. Private Sharing A shared for information that is viewable and available to selected audience, such as friends and family members in private social groups. Anonymous Account An account that has a nickname and a fake profile picture to hide the actual identity or figure with the use of social media applications. Public Figure A known person by public audience. In Saudi, a female public figure means a woman that can be recognized by her identity, name, and face. Hijab A veil that a female wears to cover her head, neck, chest, and sometimes the face while she is in public. It is also known as a thick, opaque, and loose fitting cloak that covers the whole body.   The literature review in Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive picture that shows the enormous amount of human interaction and media content in current social media sphere. Moreover, it explains the risk of cyber aggression that could be generated by the inappropriate sharing of information, and covers the different types of cyber aggression activities, risks, and effects. ","1 chapter 1 introduction background the literature revealed that the number of internet and social media users increases at a high rate due to advancements in information technology. today, internet users act as information seekers, generators, and distributors; thus, the internet has become more dynamic, where its users collaborate to increase knowledge sharing. however, this makes the amount of human interaction immeasurable, and the volume of user-generated content hard to be both controlled and monitored. the high volume of information sharing could be a positive source of information when internet communities collaborate to share valuable information. unfortunately, the cyber sphere is an open environment that allows all types of people to access it and share diverse information; therefore, negative practices such as bullying, stalking, blackmailing, harassment, and other aggressive acts have been found in the digital world and form real threats for both adult and young users (starcevic & aboujaoude, 2015). advancements in technology create a new virtual life for people to communicate and share information without restrictions of time and location. these technological tools were designed to increase the level of social interaction between people everywhere, and to allow knowledge sharing that could be accessible to everyone and at any time. social media applications have changed the way of communication, from face-to-face, screen-to-screen, or device-to-device communications. although the technological revolution has increased the level of social interaction by sharing knowledge and valuable information, these technological tools could be used to benefit the community or harm its users (shullich, 2011; starcevic & aboujaoude, 2015). 2 social media users are able to create different media content, such as textual, visual, and video. people can publicly share their information or privately via private social groups. however, sharing information over the internet and via social media networks is not totally protected from cyber risks. recently, researchers revealed that traditional aggression could be transferred to the digital world and present similar or worse psychological impacts on victims (dooley, pyzalski & cross, 2009; ito et al., 2010; zweig, dank, lachman, & yahner, 2013). researchers have investigated triggers, effects, and differences between traditional and digital aggression (o'keeffe, clarke-pearson, & council on communications and media, 2011). wong-lo and bullock (2011) stated that digital aggression is a form of online peer aggression, which can be as damaging as any form of face-to-face aggression. starcevic and aboujaoude (2015) stated that as the usage of the internet has increased, availability and speed of communication has also expanded. as a result of this, several new psychological disorders have been discovered, and many crimes are now more easily committed due to newfound digital aggression. aboujaoude and starcevic (2015) stated that with the increasing popularity of the internet, it has been found that there are new and different mental health issues that have come to light. these issues can stem from cyber aggression, risks of overexposure to information, and the glorification of overtly sexual or violent acts (aboujaoude & starcevic, 2015). the advancements of telecommunication technologies have increased the widespread use of social media applications. nowadays, social media networks have billions of users and uncountable-shared media content, and they provide easy access to browse and share different content. digital aggression is presented as a negative use of social media networks, especially when users post and share inappropriate content to harm others in public or private settings (cook, williams, guerra, & tuthill, 2007; zweig, dank, lachman, & yahner, 2013). traditional 3 aggression acts, such as bullying and stalking, have been reconstructed in a digital manner, and names such as cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and online harassment have been used to describe these aggressive acts (dooley, pyzalski & cross, 2009; ito et al., 2010; zweig, dank, lachman, & yahner, 2013). today, cyber aggression is considered one of the digital dilemmas due to the high psychological and emotional risks generated by the uncontrolled aggressive practices, which can also lead to physical risks (faryadi, 2011). these risks could cause both victims and perpetrators to experience depression, stress, anxiety, loneliness, low academic performance and productivity, eating disorders, and even suicide (baldry & winkel, 2003; mills et al., 2004; hinduja & patchin, 2010). the literature provides many studies that could prove the effects of online aggression and how it could form serious threats; thus, many researchers recommend the use of education to spread awareness of these risks, as well as how to prevent and treat them effectively (starcevic & aboujaoude, 2015). cyberbullying is mistakenly understood as conflicts among school students through the use of the internet; however, the literature has shown that cyber aggressive acts could influence both adults and young people, including school students, college students, and coworkers (al-zahrani, 2015; kowalski, limber, & agatston, 2012; smith & yoon, 2013). in one study, it was revealed that even adults could be at the risk of peer aggression: a strong association between workplace bullying and subsequent depression suggests that bullying is an etiological factor for mental health problems. the victims of bullying also seem to be at greater risk of cardiovascular disease. (kivimaki et al., 2003, p.779) 4 these previous findings would make cyber aggression a global concern that should be taken seriously and not ignored, due to its destructive psychological, emotional, and medical effects on people from different ages, genders, and cultures. saudi arabia is considered by some one of the fastest developing countries in the middle east region. the internet is provided at cheap rates and is available to everyone. saudi citizens use the internet for social interaction and sharing information on a daily basis. the use of smartphones is high due to the coverage of 3g and 4g networks in large cities and towns. the recent statistic analysis shows that there are around 20 million internet users in saudi arabia, and 14 million active social media users (citc, 2014; the social clinic, 2015). cyber aggression is a new concept for many saudi social media users, and most of them do not have a clear definition of it (see pilot study in chapter 3). the current literature presents two studies that investigated cyberbullying and cyberstalking concepts in saudi arabia. in one of these studies, the author stated that the findings come “in line with the current literature that consider cyberbullying as a global concern and can be a real risk to students and may cause them both emotional and physical harm” (al-zahrani, 2015, p.23). in this study, al-zahrani (2015) proved the prevalence of cyberbullying and its risk in saudi arabia and proved the existing of some online aggressive acts that could be consider cyberstalking. in the other study, the analysis of collected quantitative data from 500 saudi participants indicated that more than 70% of the participants answered that they have never seen or heard about cyberbullying, and with this high percentage, saudi arabia ranked with the lowest awareness about cyber aggression among the selected 24 countries in the study (ipsos global advisor, 2011). 5 due to the lack of research in the literature about cyber aggression in saudi arabia, the researcher conducted a larger-scale pilot study to explore the concept of cyber aggression in social media applications. however, all selected participants were active social media users from saudi arabia. the study was designed to collect qualitative data throughout in-depth interviews with saudi arabian students at the university of north texas (unt). the aim of the pilot study was to explore the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia as well as to understand the negative use of social media applications and the harmful information sharing practices. the transcription of the recoded interviews led to 450 pages that were analyzed by different categories of codes and themes. during the analysis process, the researcher focused on the factors that could be related to the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression. the pilot study concluded that cyber aggression and the inappropriate use and share of information were found due to lack of understanding, lack of support, and other cultural, traditional, and social aspects. chapter 3 of this dissertation presents the pilot study, its methodology, data collection, analysis, and results. purpose of the study this research was divided into two major stages. in the first stage, the main purpose was to understand cyber aggression in saudi arabia and how saudi social media users perceive and tolerate the concept in their society. it was conducted to identify constructs and factors that could explain the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in different social media platforms with the goal of developing reliable scales. these were used at the second stage. three scales: cyberbullying acceptance scale, cyberstalking acceptance scale, and wrong social media practices acceptance scale. a total of 71 items were generated from the 6 pilot study. though using a sample from saudi arabia, acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression is thought to exist in other societies with similar cultural characteristics. in other this methodology may be generalized across similar cultures. the scales and items to measure them are discussed in chapter 3 and chapter 4 of this dissertation. research problem the literature shows a strong relationship between face-to-face and digital aggression and the generated physical and psychological harm that could affect people of all ages (kowalski et al., 2012; lange, 2007; miller & hufstedler, 2009; olweus, 1993; sabina, 2010; whittaker & kowalski, 2015). past studies from different disciplines have focused on the causes and effects of aggression to prove its existence; however, there are no studies that developed scales with items to measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggressive acts in saudi arabia or in other parts of the world with similar cultural characteristics. in the following six sections, there is more deliberation of the cyber aggression dilemma related to the characteristics of saudi arabian culture. in saudi arabia, there is a lack of studies to describe digital aggression and its negative outcomes, particularly among the saudi arabian social media community. al-zahrani (2015) stated that cyberbullying has got much attention globally but “it has received little attention in developing countries, such as saudi arabia, especially from the education perspective. thus, addressing the problem in saudi arabia is necessary and may inform the research context in this area” (p.18). after conducting the pilot study, the researcher found that the lack of understanding about how many acts and their effects were cyber aggressive, and the main reasons that could lead people to accept cyber aggression and behave aggressively (see chapter 3). 7 the majority of participants stated that cyber aggression acts are very noticeable among saudi social media users; however, they believe that people do not understand what is acceptable and not acceptable, and most of the problems are caused by information sharing practices. furthermore, the lack of awareness and lack of immediate support were other factors that could increase the size of cyber aggression problem. it was concluded that the concept of cyber aggression is new for the majority of social media users in saudi arabia. people do not realize or understand the cyber aggression problems, they could not recognize the serious consequences on adults, adolescents, and children; thus, society members chose to accept or tolerate them not realizing the effects of aggressive acts. in 2010, the population of saudi arabia was 29.6 million, and the number is expected to be 35 million by 2020 (international monetary fund, 2015). more than 50% of the total population is under 25 years (murphy, 2012). the last statistical report by the communication and information technology commission (citc) indicates that the number of internet users in saudi arabia is roughly 20 million (citc, 2014). the old statistic by globalwebindex (2012) indicates that there were around 9 million active social media users in saudi arabia. however, the number of social media users increased in recent years and reached around 14 million in early 2015 (the social clinic, 2015). in another report, it was found that the majority of internet users in saudi arabia “spent 2.39 hours social networking and 1.45 hours microblogging daily, for a total of 3.84 hours of time spent online each day” (winkels et al, 2013, p.28). this could stress the importance of social media applications in saudi arabia. although the social media has changed human interactions, cyberbullying via social media was found in saudi arabia (al-zahrani, 2015). 8 cyberbullying rate in saudi arabia has increased compared with reuters global report in 2012, from 18% to about 27%. the increase in cyberbullying rate might indicate a serious prevailing problem and requires further action, despite the fact that these rates are still among the lowest rates globally. (al-zahrani, 2015, p.23) yet, cyber aggression is not well understood or documented in saudi arabia due to lack of studies in the literature, lack of education, and lack of understanding and awareness toward cyber aggression (al-zahrani, 2015; ipsos global advisor, 2011; pilot study in chapter 3). the literature has proven the side effects of digital aggression and how it can lead victims to harmful psychological problems, mental illnesses, suicidal thoughts, and even suicide in severe cases (baldry & winkel, 2003; mills et al., 2004; hinduja & patchin, 2010). research findings have shown that people who become victims of cyber aggression face excessive stress in their life (beebe, 2010). in saudi arabia, psychological problems are considered a type of stigma that should be hidden from society. at the same time, most of female patients cannot visit psychiatrists alone or without a guardian (abdelwahid & al-shahrani, 2011; al-qadhi, rahman, farwana, & imad addin, 2014; bassiony, 2005). in many cases, the victims and their families suffer without consultation or medical care because they do not want to reveal their problems. hiding problems would make these issues more problematic when compared to other cultures (the western world, more developed countries, etc.) the victims may find themselves forced to hide their problems and harmful symptoms from close family members, friends, and society. often this is because they do not want to be labeled with names that they consider shameful such as unstable, foolish, or mentally ill; at the same time, victims do not want their problems to become worse and affect their social standing (see chapter 3). one study found that the rate of depression in saudi arabia has increased in recent years, and most general practitioners and medical doctors are not well prepared to diagnose depression; 9 therefore, it was recommended that the screening of “depression should be implemented in primary care settings” (al-qadhi, rahman, farwana, & imad addin, 2014, p.7). another study found that the excessive use of social media and isolation led high school students in riyadh to experience depression and high-level anxiety (alnezi, 2014). however, the author of this study did not discuss if cyber aggression was one of the triggers to these psychological problems. none of the studies in the literature discussed the possible link between cyber aggression and psychological problems in saudi arabia. in saudi society, mixing between genders is not accepted in public places, and women are required to be fully covered while they are in public to adhere to society values and traditions. currently, the internet is used as an important means for socializing. sharing textual and visual information among different groups takes place despite the gender of users. at the same time, there is monitoring of social interactions on the internet but it is impossible to have full control of those interactions; thus, the massive interaction between million of social media users in saudi arabia is thought to include cyber aggression. the increased level of interactions in today's social media applications, along with many diverse societal, cultural, and traditional aspects could influence the behaviors of social media users and may lead to cyber aggression justifications. it was found that men presented more aggression than women in saudi arabia, which may affect the safety of individuals in saudi cyber sphere (al-zahrani, 2015). this could be attributed to the nature of saudi arabian society, given that it is a male dominated society (al-salem, 2005). in saudi arabia culture, males are perceived as guardians responsible for maintaining cultural and traditional values. thus, the culturally biased gender differences could be a contributing factor in the increased cyber bullying by men toward women who use social media applications and may act out of the norms of 10 the society at large. there is a need to understand cyber aggression and the related factors that may affect the social media behaviors, acceptance, and tolerance toward the digital aggression. the literature and the pilot study revealed that the lack of understanding about legal consequences, the absent of law enforcement, and anonymity play a large role in increasing the level of online aggression among social media users (akbulut & eristi, 2011; grigg, 2012; pilot study in chapter 3). cyberbullying and cyberstalking acts, such as spreading rumors, posting personal and sensitive information in public, or sharing humiliating videos or any information that could affect the social standing of the victim are regulated by the anti-cyber crime law. however, these laws are not well publicized in saudi arabia (elnaim, 2013). many people practice cyber aggressive acts without knowing the possible penalties, and most of them believe that their acts are not considered crimes. one of the participants from the pilot study was asked about the cyberbullying problems in saudi arabia, and he stated it’s a huge problem, and it's impacting people in a bad way, and we should have an immediate response to what's happening now, especially that we have people back home [saudi arabia] who are like addicted to social media, and they are not educated about the rules of social media [cyber crime law]. (appendix d: file_ [21674-22070], p. 221) the pilot study revealed that aggression is very noticeable in social media applications; the high level of exposure affects people, and they learn many of the negative practices from their peers. in the absence of parent control the self-control, these aggressive acts become more acceptable and tolerable, and this could be related to certain social aspects. for example, bandura (1978, 1986) in his social learning theory and aggression explained that people learn from their observed surroundings; thus, many aggressive behaviors can be learned from watching and imitating others. in social media, people could encounter aggression in their daily activities with friends and unknown people via social media. 11 aggressive behavior is based on the learning, activation, and application of aggression-related knowledge structures stored in memory. such learning takes place through encounters with the physical and social world. much learning occurs through observing real and functional characters [or it may occur through online observation]. (carnagey, anderson, & bushman, 2007, p.491) in the pilot study, participants affirmed the prevalence of cyber aggression, and they believed that people learn from each other and through online observations. the exposure to cyber aggression via social media applications on a daily basis could encourage cyber aggression acts; therefore, the researcher took these issues into carful consideration to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber aggression and all related factors. importantly, measuring the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance would help in understanding the size of the cyber aggression problem and how the aggressive social interactions could impact social media users and spread the cyber aggression in saudi arabia. problem statement although the literature has shown the existence of digital aggression and its physiological effects, measuring the acceptance of these aggressive acts via social media applications remains unexamined for the most part. most of current scales in the literature are purposefully designed to study the occurrence of digital aggression, such as e-victimisation scale and e-bullying scale (lam & li, 2013), which were produced based on the aggression and victimization scale by orpinas and horne (2010). however, these scales do not measure the acceptance of cyber aggression among social media users. a number of the studies proved the prevalence of digital aggression, the rates of its occurrence, and its effects on adults and youth people (beran & li, 2005; beran & li, 2008; dehue, bolman, & vollink, 2008; mishna, khoury-kassabri, gadalla, & daciuk, 2012). however, none of these studies investigated whether these online aggressive behaviors and acts might be socially accepted or tolerated, or their circumstances. 12 significance of the study hanewald (2008) states that although cyber aggression was found to cause many psychological problems that could lead to physical violence and crimes and that the “educational community around the world has only made a small contribution” (p.2). the literature has presented the prevalence of digital aggression and its associated side effects; however, measuring the acceptance and tolerance of these online aggressive acts and hostile behaviors is still undiscovered. measuring cyber aggression through the use of social media applications would help to expand our knowledge about cyber aggression and discuss it from a new perspective. in this study, cyber aggression was investigated in a different way by measuring how acceptable it is to bully or stalk someone in the digital world; at the same time, measuring how people tolerate different cyber aggressive acts. the literature lacks studies and descriptions about cyberbullying and cyberstalking in saudi culture. there is a large demand to investigate the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia. al-zahrani (2015) concluded that “further research using different types of methodologies are required to address the problem and investigate the impacts of cyberbullying on students’ learning and social life” (p.24). moreover, this study could provide a comprehensive understanding about the cyber aggression concept and new information to the literature about the saudi digital culture. the study considered the dilemma of digital aggression and used the mixed methods approach by conducting a qualitative pilot study in its first stage and a quantitative approach in the second stage to create reliable and valid scales that can measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression, including the acceptance of wrong practices of sharing aggressive information and media via social media applications. the literature revealed that 13 aggression in the cyber sphere could lead to face-to-face aggression, physical harm, and violence. thus, measuring cyber aggression would help in understanding the size of problem, providing proper help and support, and preventing possible future incidents and crimes. understanding the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance could inform researchers, educators, parents, and even managers in workplaces about the rate of cyber aggression and help in designing required educational programs to raise the level of awareness and providing the required support and help resources. research questions the pilot study included a qualitative approach to collect descriptive data through a number of interviews with selected participants. the researcher used open-ended questions to explore the cyber aggression phenomena expansively. the researcher arranged the interview questions in six sections (see appendix c). the researcher used, then, a survey of social media users in saudi arabia. as stated previously, the purpose of this research is to develop an instrument that could measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of online aggressive practices as well as measuring the negative use and share of information via social media applications to answer the following research questions: q1. what factors could explain cyber aggression via social media applications in saudi arabia? q2. to what extent do social media users in saudi arabia accept and tolerate cyber aggression? q3. to what extent do information-sharing practices affect social media users in saudi arabia? 14 limitations of the study this study focused on the phenomenon of cyber aggression, the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggressive acts. data were collected of mainly saudi arabian social media users. the researcher selected saudi arabian students who live in the dallas/fort worth area to participate in the initial interviews (pilot study). therefore, they were in the united states and were more aware of the cyber aggression concept from their personal contacts or their children’s schools. the interviews revealed that the participants had heard about cyber aggression and strongly believed that people in saudi arabia would not be familiar with the concept because saudi society ignores it and there is no interest in schools or tv media to increase general awareness of this type of aggression among the general society. the pilot study cannot affirm that people in saudi arabia have never heard about cyber aggression. another related issue is that the researcher conducted the exploratory pilot study to collect the participants’ understandings and meanings of cyber aggression; nevertheless, the researcher used a small sample size of saudi students (14 participants) who live in the united states. this is a limitation that could affect the items in the scales because the researcher has assumptions based on the views of people who live outside saudi arabia and had the chance to understand the concepts of cyber aggression. these scales were developed based on participants’ understanding of the concept of cyber aggression, and it is predictable that saudi social media users who live in saudi arabia and have never heard about cyber aggression would have different understandings and meanings of this concept. the designed scales were developed based on the analysis of collected qualitative data via the interviews with saudi social media users, thus, the scales’ items would be suitable to measure cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in other countries with similar cultural views. 15 notably, what is acceptable or tolerable in the some cultures may be an unsuitable act in the saudi culture. there is a need for some modifications on these developed scales to make them reliable and valid across all cultures, though generalization may be possible across others that are similar. the pilot study provided a comprehensive picture of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and then the researcher focused on examining the reliability of scales and tried to increase their reliability values by removing irrelevant items. there is a need for more studies to test these developed scales and increase their reliability and examine them with larger different samples. definition of terms this section provides a table at the end defines the different terms in this dissertation. it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation of main terms related to the cyber aggression and developed scales. there is also a need to understand the meaning of acceptability and tolerability because the literature shows that people refuse to accept negative acts and they hide them or find another name to justify their actions (spaniol & gagne, 1997). terms of cyber aggression cyberbullying is the conscious, deliberate, repeated and hostile behavior by one or more people who intend to harm others via the use of technology (hinduja & patchin, 2014). for example, calling disrespectful names, sending unwanted messages, spreading rumors, posting humiliating information, or spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings. cyberstalking is a course of online conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear (hanewald, 2008). for examples, sending aggressive massages, 16 posting false information, and spreading nasty rumors or defamations that all jeopardize victims’ social status, personal and professional relationships, reputation, and future. wrong social media practices include the unsafe use of social media applications by sharing personal information and sensitive information, ignoring privacy settings, spreading false information, ignoring cyber policies, etc. however, personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information; thus, it is a multi-dimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity. personal pictures, private videos, family issues, health issues, finical issues, future plans, and secrets could be personal and sensitive information. acceptability and tolerability spaniol and gagne (1997) defined acceptance as a process that “involves both emotional as well as cognitive aspects of ourselves. it is not simply a matter of making a decision. it involves working out this decision emotionally and through our actions” (p.75). they added that acceptance means “seeing and acknowledging all the various aspects of oneself without devaluing oneself” (p.75). in this vine, people may practice aggression without recognizing it as a harmful act that could lead to that type of negative acceptance. spaniol and gagne (1997) stated that acceptance “means seeing ourselves as we are, without judging ourselves” (p.76). it could denote that people may do what they do without thinking or judging their acts, whether they harm others or not. it was mentioned that acceptance needs support from others, because supporting the act would make it acceptable to many people in society, and this acceptance would lead to more acceptance for both those who do the act as well as those who observe it (anthony, 1993; spaniol & gagne, 1997). this type of support could play a role in expanding the size of acceptability. spaniol and gagne (1997) stated that the process of acceptance is “ [a] process 17 with people and events. we are not alone in how we experience and respond to our life” (p.76). spreading acceptance to members of society is complex because it is “a process that may take a long time. it involves all of us, our mind, our body, our emotions, and our behavior” (spaniol & gagne, 1997, p.77). it was declared that acceptance is a process that would make a person accept an act without devaluing it, and this acceptance could happen at one's own discretion without any force. at the same time, a person may deal with the act without accepting it; in other words, a person may tolerate the act without totally accepting it or rejecting it. from a psychology perspective, tolerance is defined as “a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry” (fish, 2014, para.3). the pilot study revealed that some participants would not accept the practice of cyber aggression but they would tolerate it. participants were able to justify cyber aggression while at the same time they would object the justification. a number of participants in the pilot study believed that social media users in saudi arabia may act aggressively but they may not realize that their acts are aggressive when the society ignores these acts. fatany (2013) stated that most of bullying cases in schools are ignored, and this could be an alarming sign that, when these acts are not considered important, people may try to accept or justify and tolerate them. to differentiate between acceptance and tolerance, fish (2014) stated that acceptance is “a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit” (fish, 2014, para.4). on the other hand, tolerating does not necessarily mean accepting, because tolerance “is only possible when some action or practice is objectionable to us, but we have 18 overriding reasons to allow that action or practice to take place” (powell & clarke, 2013, p.3). they added that when “we decide to tolerate an action or a practice, we decide to forego an opportunity to interfere in some instance of that activity or practice” (powell & clarke, 2013, p.3). this means that people may tolerate cyber aggressive acts for some reasons without accepting them, or they may accept actions without seeing any objection to refuse them. acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance. if a sign of tolerance is a feeling of ‘i can live with x (behavior, religion, race, culture, etc.)’ acceptance moves beyond that in the direction of ‘x is ok.’ you can tolerate something without accepting it, but you cannot accept something without tolerating it. for example, when a son or daughter tells a parent about an unwelcome career choice, marital partner, or sexual identity, he or she wants that information not just to be tolerated, but to be accepted. (fish, 2014, para.6) in this dissertation, the term acceptance was used to determine whether social media users in saudi arabia accept cyber aggression, or if they may tolerate it under certain circumstances. the pilot study revealed that participants have a level of toleration towards cyber aggression due to a number of factors (see chapter 3). it is logical that accepting cyber aggression could be more severe than tolerating it, however, tolerating cyber aggression does not make it less harmful than accepting it. when problems are ignored or left without solutions they may lead to severe psychological and emotional damages, as well as a high crime rate (alamri, 2015; fatany, 2013). the following table provides definitions for the most significant terms used in this dissertation. it is critical to define these terms in advance in order to create a proper literature review about the selected topic in this research. 19 table 1 definition of terms terms definitions cyber aggression any aggressive acts carried out by individuals or groups, using electronic technology, that occur repeatedly against victims who cannot defend themselves. the offenses will be prevalent over the internet to reach an unlimited number of people in fast time (slonje & smith, 2008). cyberbullying willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices (hinduja & patchin, 2014). harm includes calling disrespectful names, sending unwanted messages, spreading rumors, posting humiliating information, and spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings. cyberstalking a form of pressure that occurs by monitoring a person’s activities via the internet and social media and invading his or her privacy by unwanted contact with targets or revealing personal or sensitive information that would cause fear and discomfort (hanewald, 2008). information sensitivity any personal information that should be kept away from public access. however, personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information; thus, it is multi-dimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity. examples are personal pictures, private videos, family issues, health issues, finical issues, future plans, secrets, etc. social media networks electronic communication tools (like internet websites or applications for social networking and blogging) where users are the main creator and distributor for the shared information among online communities. 20 terms definitions

relevant keyword, phrase, or event with no spaces in tweets to categorize them with words that can be easily reached and shared. instagram a social media application that runs on smartphones and tablets. it allows for textual, visual, and limited video streaming sharing up to 15 seconds, and makes them viewable to public or private users. youtube an online social networking service that

veil that a female wears to cover her head, neck, chest, and sometimes the face while she is in public. it is also known as a thick, opaque, and loose fitting cloak that covers the whole body. the literature review in chapter 2 provides a comprehensive picture that shows the enormous amount of human interaction and media content in current social media sphere. moreover, it explains the risk of cyber aggression that could be generated by the inappropriate sharing of information, and covers the different types of cyber aggression activities, risks, and effects.",1 chapter 1 introduction background the literature revealed that the number of internet and social media users increases at a high rate due to advancements in information technology today internet users act as information seekers generators and distributors thus the internet has become more dynamic where its users collaborate to increase knowledge sharing however this makes the amount of human interaction immeasurable and the volume of usergenerated content hard to be both controlled and monitored the high volume of information sharing could be a positive source of information when internet communities collaborate to share valuable information unfortunately the cyber sphere is an open environment that allows all types of people to access it and share diverse information therefore negative practices such as

daily basis the use of smartphones is high due to the coverage of 3g and 4g networks in large cities and towns the recent statistic analysis shows that there are around 20 million internet users in saudi arabia and 14 million active social media users citc 2014 the social clinic 2015 cyber aggression is a new concept for many saudi social media users and most of them do not have a clear definition of it see pilot study in chapter 3 the current literature presents two studies that investigated cyberbullying and cyberstalking concepts in saudi arabia in one of these studies the author stated that the findings come “in line with the current literature that consider cyberbullying as a global concern and can be a real risk to students and may cause them both emotional and physical harm” alzahrani 2015 p23 in this study alzahrani 2015 proved the prevalence of cyberbullying and its risk in saudi arabia and proved the existing of some online aggressive acts that could be consider cyberstalking in the other study the analysis of collected quantitative data from 500 saudi participants indicated that more than 70 of the participants answered that they have never seen or heard about cyberbullying and with this high percentage saudi arabia ranked with the lowest awareness about cyber aggression among the selected 24 countries in the study ipsos global advisor 2011 5 due to the lack of research in the literature about cyber aggression in saudi arabia the researcher conducted a largerscale pilot study to explore the concept of cyber aggression in social media applications however all selected participants were active social media users from saudi arabia the study was designed to collect qualitative data throughout indepth interviews with saudi arabian students at the university of north texas unt the aim of the pilot study was to explore the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia as well as to understand the negative use of social media applications and the harmful information sharing practices the transcription of the recoded interviews led to 450 pages that were analyzed by different categories of codes and themes during the analysis process the researcher focused on the factors that could be related to the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression the pilot study concluded that cyber aggression and the inappropriate use and share of information were found due to lack of understanding lack of support and other cultural traditional and social aspects chapter 3 of this dissertation presents the pilot study its methodology data collection analysis and results purpose of the study this research was divided into two major stages in the first stage the main purpose was to understand cyber aggression in saudi arabia and how saudi social media users perceive and tolerate the concept in their society it was conducted to identify constructs and factors that could explain the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in different social media platforms with the goal of developing reliable scales these were used at the second stage three scales cyberbullying acceptance scale cyberstalking acceptance scale and wrong social media practices acceptance scale a total of 71 items were generated from the 6 pilot study though using a sample from saudi arabia acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression is thought to exist in other societies with similar cultural characteristics in other this methodology may be generalized across similar cultures the scales and items to measure them are discussed in chapter 3 and chapter 4 of this dissertation research problem the literature shows a strong relationship between facetoface and digital aggression and the generated physical and psychological harm that could affect people of all ages kowalski et al 2012 lange 2007 miller  hufstedler 2009 olweus 1993 sabina 2010 whittaker  kowalski 2015 past studies from different disciplines have focused on the causes and effects of aggression to prove its existence however there are no studies that developed scales with items to measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggressive acts in saudi arabia or in other parts of the world with similar cultural characteristics in the following six sections there is more deliberation of the cyber aggression dilemma related to the characteristics of saudi arabian culture in saudi arabia there is a lack of studies to describe digital aggression and its negative outcomes particularly among the saudi arabian social media community alzahrani 2015 stated that cyberbullying has got much attention globally but “it has received little attention in developing countries such as saudi arabia especially from the education perspective thus addressing the problem in saudi arabia is necessary and may inform the research context in this area” p18 after conducting the pilot study the researcher found that the lack of understanding about how many acts and their effects were cyber aggressive and the main reasons that could lead people to accept cyber aggression and behave aggressively see chapter 3 7 the majority of participants stated that cyber aggression acts are very noticeable among saudi social media users however they believe that people do not understand what is acceptable and not acceptable and most of the problems are caused by information sharing practices furthermore the lack of awareness and lack of immediate support were other factors that could increase the size of cyber aggression problem it was concluded that the concept of cyber aggression is new for the majority of social media users in saudi arabia people do not realize or understand the cyber aggression problems they could not recognize the serious consequences on adults adolescents and children thus society members chose to accept or tolerate them not realizing the effects of aggressive acts in 2010 the population of saudi arabia was 296 million and the number is expected to be 35 million by 2020 international monetary fund 2015 more than 50 of the total population is under 25 years murphy 2012 the last statistical report by the communication and information technology commission citc indicates that the number of internet users in saudi arabia is roughly 20 million citc 2014 the old statistic by globalwebindex 2012 indicates that there were around 9 million active social media users in saudi arabia however the number of social media users increased in recent years and reached around 14 million in early 2015 the social clinic 2015 in another report it was found that the majority of internet users in saudi arabia “spent 239 hours social networking and 145 hours microblogging daily for a total of 384 hours of time spent online each day” winkels et al 2013 p28 this could stress the importance of social media applications in saudi arabia although the social media has changed human interactions cyberbullying via social media was found in saudi arabia alzahrani 2015 8 cyberbullying rate in saudi arabia has increased compared with reuters global report in 2012 from 18 to about 27 the increase in cyberbullying rate might indicate a serious prevailing problem and requires further action despite the fact that these rates are still among the lowest rates globally alzahrani 2015 p23 yet cyber aggression is not well understood or documented in saudi arabia due to lack of studies in the literature lack of education and lack of understanding and awareness toward cyber aggression alzahrani 2015 ipsos global advisor 2011 pilot study in chapter 3 the literature has proven the side effects of digital aggression and how it can lead victims to harmful psychological problems mental illnesses suicidal thoughts and even suicide in severe cases baldry  winkel 2003 mills et al 2004 hinduja  patchin 2010 research findings have shown that people who become victims of cyber aggression face excessive stress in their life beebe 2010 in saudi arabia psychological problems are considered a type of stigma that should be hidden from society at the same time most of female patients cannot visit psychiatrists alone or without a guardian abdelwahid  alshahrani 2011 alqadhi rahman farwana  imad addin 2014 bassiony 2005 in many cases the victims and their families suffer without consultation or medical care because they do not want to reveal their problems hiding problems would make these issues more problematic when compared to other cultures the western world more developed countries etc the victims may find themselves forced to hide their problems and harmful symptoms from close family members friends and society often this is because they do not want to be labeled with names that they consider shameful such as unstable foolish or mentally ill at the same time victims do not want their problems to become worse and affect their social standing see chapter 3 one study found that the rate of depression in saudi arabia has increased in recent years and most general practitioners and medical doctors are not well prepared to diagnose depression 9 therefore it was recommended that the screening of “depression should be implemented in primary care settings” alqadhi rahman farwana  imad addin 2014 p7 another study found that the excessive use of social media and isolation led high school students in riyadh to experience depression and highlevel anxiety alnezi 2014 however the author of this study did not discuss if cyber aggression was one of the triggers to these psychological problems none of the studies in the literature discussed the possible link between cyber aggression and psychological problems in saudi arabia in saudi society mixing between genders is not accepted in public places and women are required to be fully covered while they are in public to adhere to society values and traditions currently the internet is used as an important means for socializing sharing textual and visual information among different groups takes place despite the gender of users at the same time there is monitoring of social interactions on the internet but it is impossible to have full control of those interactions thus the massive interaction between million of social media users in saudi arabia is thought to include cyber aggression the increased level of interactions in todays social media applications along with many diverse societal cultural and traditional aspects could influence the behaviors of social media users and may lead to cyber aggression justifications it was found that men presented more aggression than women in saudi arabia which may affect the safety of individuals in saudi cyber sphere alzahrani 2015 this could be attributed to the nature of saudi arabian society given that it is a male dominated society alsalem 2005 in saudi arabia culture males are perceived as guardians responsible for maintaining cultural and traditional values thus the culturally biased gender differences could be a contributing factor in the increased cyber bullying by men toward women who use social media applications and may act out of the norms of 10 the society at large there is a need to understand cyber aggression and the related factors that may affect the social media behaviors acceptance and tolerance toward the digital aggression the literature and the pilot study revealed that the lack of understanding about legal consequences the absent of law enforcement and anonymity play a large role in increasing the level of online aggression among social media users akbulut  eristi 2011 grigg 2012 pilot study in chapter 3 cyberbullying and cyberstalking acts such as spreading rumors posting personal and sensitive information in public or sharing humiliating videos or any information that could affect the social standing of the victim are regulated by the anticyber crime law however these laws are not well publicized in saudi arabia elnaim 2013 many people practice cyber aggressive acts without knowing the possible penalties and most of them believe that their acts are not considered crimes one of the participants from the pilot study was asked about the cyberbullying problems in saudi arabia and he stated it’s a huge problem and its impacting people in a bad way and we should have an immediate response to whats happening now especially that we have people back home saudi arabia who are like addicted to social media and they are not educated about the rules of social media cyber crime law appendix d file 2167422070 p 221 the pilot study revealed that aggression is very noticeable in social media applications the high level of exposure affects people and they learn many of the negative practices from their peers in the absence of parent control the selfcontrol these aggressive acts become more acceptable and tolerable and this could be related to certain social aspects for example bandura 1978 1986 in his social learning theory and aggression explained that people learn from their observed surroundings thus many aggressive behaviors can be learned from watching and imitating others in social media people could encounter aggression in their daily activities with friends and unknown people via social media 11 aggressive behavior is based on the learning activation and application of aggressionrelated knowledge structures stored in memory such learning takes place through encounters with the physical and social world much learning occurs through observing real and functional characters or it may occur through online observation carnagey anderson  bushman 2007 p491 in the pilot study participants affirmed the prevalence of cyber aggression and they believed that people learn from each other and through online observations the exposure to cyber aggression via social media applications on a daily basis could encourage cyber aggression acts therefore the researcher took these issues into carful consideration to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber aggression and all related factors importantly measuring the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance would help in understanding the size of the cyber aggression problem and how the aggressive social interactions could impact social media users and spread the cyber aggression in saudi arabia problem statement although the literature has shown the existence of digital aggression and its physiological effects measuring the acceptance of these aggressive acts via social media applications remains unexamined for the most part most of current scales in the literature are purposefully designed to study the occurrence of digital aggression such as evictimisation scale and ebullying scale lam  li 2013 which were produced based on the aggression and victimization scale by orpinas and horne 2010 however these scales do not measure the acceptance of cyber aggression among social media users a number of the studies proved the prevalence of digital aggression the rates of its occurrence and its effects on adults and youth people beran  li 2005 beran  li 2008 dehue bolman  vollink 2008 mishna khourykassabri gadalla  daciuk 2012 however none of these studies investigated whether these online aggressive behaviors and acts might be socially accepted or tolerated or their circumstances 12 significance of the study hanewald 2008 states that although cyber aggression was found to cause many psychological problems that could lead to physical violence and crimes and that the “educational community around the world has only made a small contribution” p2 the literature has presented the prevalence of digital aggression and its associated side effects however measuring the acceptance and tolerance of these online aggressive acts and hostile behaviors is still undiscovered measuring cyber aggression through the use of social media applications would help to expand our knowledge about cyber aggression and discuss it from a new perspective in this study cyber aggression was investigated in a different way by measuring how acceptable it is to bully or stalk someone in the digital world at the same time measuring how people tolerate different cyber aggressive acts the literature lacks studies and descriptions about cyberbullying and cyberstalking in saudi culture there is a large demand to investigate the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia alzahrani 2015 concluded that “further research using different types of methodologies are required to address the problem and investigate the impacts of cyberbullying on students’ learning and social life” p24 moreover this study could provide a comprehensive understanding about the cyber aggression concept and new information to the literature about the saudi digital culture the study considered the dilemma of digital aggression and used the mixed methods approach by conducting a qualitative pilot study in its first stage and a quantitative approach in the second stage to create reliable and valid scales that can measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression including the acceptance of wrong practices of sharing aggressive information and media via social media applications the literature revealed that 13 aggression in the cyber sphere could lead to facetoface aggression physical harm and violence thus measuring cyber aggression would help in understanding the size of problem providing proper help and support and preventing possible future incidents and crimes understanding the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance could inform researchers educators parents and even managers in workplaces about the rate of cyber aggression and help in designing required educational programs to raise the level of awareness and providing the required support and help resources research questions the pilot study included a qualitative approach to collect descriptive data through a number of interviews with selected participants the researcher used openended questions to explore the cyber aggression phenomena expansively the researcher arranged the interview questions in six sections see appendix c the researcher used then a survey of social media users in saudi arabia as stated previously the purpose of this research is to develop an instrument that could measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of online aggressive practices as well as measuring the negative use and share of information via social media applications to answer the following research questions q1 what factors could explain cyber aggression via social media applications in saudi arabia q2 to what extent do social media users in saudi arabia accept and tolerate cyber aggression q3 to what extent do informationsharing practices affect social media users in saudi arabia 14 limitations of the study this study focused on the phenomenon of cyber aggression the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggressive acts data were collected of mainly saudi arabian social media users the researcher selected saudi arabian students who live in the dallasfort worth area to participate in the initial interviews pilot study therefore they were in the united states and were more aware of the cyber aggression concept from their personal contacts or their children’s schools the interviews revealed that the participants had heard about cyber aggression and strongly believed that people in saudi arabia would not be familiar with the concept because saudi society ignores it and there is no interest in schools or tv media to increase general awareness of this type of aggression among the general society the pilot study cannot affirm that people in saudi arabia have never heard about cyber aggression another related issue is that the researcher conducted the exploratory pilot study to collect the participants’ understandings and meanings of cyber aggression nevertheless the researcher used a small sample size of saudi students 14 participants who live in the united states this is a limitation that could affect the items in the scales because the researcher has assumptions based on the views of people who live outside saudi arabia and had the chance to understand the concepts of cyber aggression these scales were developed based on participants’ understanding of the concept of cyber aggression and it is predictable that saudi social media users who live in saudi arabia and have never heard about cyber aggression would have different understandings and meanings of this concept the designed scales were developed based on the analysis of collected qualitative data via the interviews with saudi social media users thus the scales’ items would be suitable to measure cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in other countries with similar cultural views 15 notably what is acceptable or tolerable in the some cultures may be an unsuitable act in the saudi culture there is a need for some modifications on these developed scales to make them reliable and valid across all cultures though generalization may be possible across others that are similar the pilot study provided a comprehensive picture of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and then the researcher focused on examining the reliability of scales and tried to increase their reliability values by removing irrelevant items there is a need for more studies to test these developed scales and increase their reliability and examine them with larger different samples definition of terms this section provides a table at the end defines the different terms in this dissertation it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation of main terms related to the cyber aggression and developed scales there is also a need to understand the meaning of acceptability and tolerability because the literature shows that people refuse to accept negative acts and they hide them or find another name to justify their actions spaniol  gagne 1997 terms of cyber aggression cyberbullying is the conscious deliberate repeated and hostile behavior by one or more people who intend to harm others via the use of technology hinduja  patchin 2014 for example calling disrespectful names sending unwanted messages spreading rumors posting humiliating information or spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings cyberstalking is a course of online conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear hanewald 2008 for examples sending aggressive massages 16 posting false information and spreading nasty rumors or defamations that all jeopardize victims’ social status personal and professional relationships reputation and future wrong social media practices include the unsafe use of social media applications by sharing personal information and sensitive information ignoring privacy settings spreading false information ignoring cyber policies etc however personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information thus it is a multidimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity personal pictures private videos family issues health issues finical issues future plans and secrets could be personal and sensitive information acceptability and tolerability spaniol and gagne 1997 defined acceptance as a process that “involves both emotional as well as cognitive aspects of ourselves it is not simply a matter of making a decision it involves working out this decision emotionally and through our actions” p75 they added that acceptance means “seeing and acknowledging all the various aspects of oneself without devaluing oneself” p75 in this vine people may practice aggression without recognizing it as a harmful act that could lead to that type of negative acceptance spaniol and gagne 1997 stated that acceptance “means seeing ourselves as we are without judging ourselves” p76 it could denote that people may do what they do without thinking or judging their acts whether they harm others or not it was mentioned that acceptance needs support from others because supporting the act would make it acceptable to many people in society and this acceptance would lead to more acceptance for both those who do the act as well as those who observe it anthony 1993 spaniol  gagne 1997 this type of support could play a role in expanding the size of acceptability spaniol and gagne 1997 stated that the process of acceptance is “ a process 17 with people and events we are not alone in how we experience and respond to our life” p76 spreading acceptance to members of society is complex because it is “a process that may take a long time it involves all of us our mind our body our emotions and our behavior” spaniol  gagne 1997 p77 it was declared that acceptance is a process that would make a person accept an act without devaluing it and this acceptance could happen at ones own discretion without any force at the same time a person may deal with the act without accepting it in other words a person may tolerate the act without totally accepting it or rejecting it from a psychology perspective tolerance is defined as “a fair objective and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions practices race religion nationality etc differ from ones own freedom from bigotry” fish 2014 para3 the pilot study revealed that some participants would not accept the practice of cyber aggression but they would tolerate it participants were able to justify cyber aggression while at the same time they would object the justification a number of participants in the pilot study believed that social media users in saudi arabia may act aggressively but they may not realize that their acts are aggressive when the society ignores these acts fatany 2013 stated that most of bullying cases in schools are ignored and this could be an alarming sign that when these acts are not considered important people may try to accept or justify and tolerate them to differentiate between acceptance and tolerance fish 2014 stated that acceptance is “a persons assent to the reality of a situation recognizing a process or condition often a negative or uncomfortable situation without attempting to change it protest or exit” fish 2014 para4 on the other hand tolerating does not necessarily mean accepting because tolerance “is only possible when some action or practice is objectionable to us but we have 18 overriding reasons to allow that action or practice to take place” powell  clarke 2013 p3 they added that when “we decide to tolerate an action or a practice we decide to forego an opportunity to interfere in some instance of that activity or practice” powell  clarke 2013 p3 this means that people may tolerate cyber aggressive acts for some reasons without accepting them or they may accept actions without seeing any objection to refuse them acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance if a sign of tolerance is a feeling of ‘i can live with x behavior religion race culture etc’ acceptance moves beyond that in the direction of ‘x is ok’ you can tolerate something without accepting it but you cannot accept something without tolerating it for example when a son or daughter tells a parent about an unwelcome career choice marital partner or sexual identity he or she wants that information not just to be tolerated but to be accepted fish 2014 para6 in this dissertation the term acceptance was used to determine whether social media users in saudi arabia accept cyber aggression or if they may tolerate it under certain circumstances the pilot study revealed that participants have a level of toleration towards cyber aggression due to a number of factors see chapter 3 it is logical that accepting cyber aggression could be more severe than tolerating it however tolerating cyber aggression does not make it less harmful than accepting it when problems are ignored or left without solutions they may lead to severe psychological and emotional damages as well as a high crime rate alamri 2015 fatany 2013 the following table provides definitions for the most significant terms used in this dissertation it is critical to define these terms in advance in order to create a proper literature review about the selected topic in this research 19 table 1 definition of terms terms definitions cyber aggression any aggressive acts carried out by individuals or groups using electronic technology that occur repeatedly against victims who cannot defend themselves the offenses will be prevalent over the internet to reach an unlimited number of people in fast time slonje  smith 2008 cyberbullying willful and repeated harm

provides a comprehensive picture that shows the enormous amount of human interaction and media content in current social media sphere moreover it explains the risk of cyber aggression that could be generated by the inappropriate sharing of information and covers the different types of cyber aggression activities risks and effects,1 chapter 1 introduction background the literature revealed that the number of internet and social media users increases at a high rate due to advancements in information technology today internet users act as information seekers generators and distributors thus the internet has become more dynamic where its users collaborate to increase knowledge sharing however this makes the amount of human interaction immeasurable and the volume of usergenerated content hard to be both controlled and monitored the high volume of information sharing could be a positive source of information when internet communities collaborate to share valuable information unfortunately the cyber sphere is an open environment that allows all types of people to access it and share diverse information therefore negative practices such as bullying stalking blackmailing harassment and other aggressive acts have been found in the digital world and form real threats for both adult and young users starcevic aboujaoude 2015 advancements in technology create a new virtual life for people to communicate and share information without restrictions of time and location these technological tools were designed to increase the level of social interaction between people everywhere and to allow knowledge sharing that could be accessible to everyone and at any time social media applications have changed the way of communication from facetoface screentoscreen or devicetodevice communications although the technological revolution has increased the level of social interaction by sharing knowledge and valuable information these technological tools could be used to benefit the community or harm its users shullich 2011 starcevic aboujaoude 2015 2 social media users are able to create different media content such as textual visual and video people can publicly share their information or privately via private social groups however sharing information over the internet and via social media networks is not totally protected from cyber risks recently researchers revealed that traditional aggression could be transferred to the digital world and present similar or worse psychological impacts on victims dooley pyzalski cross 2009 ito et al 2010 zweig dank lachman yahner 2013 researchers have investigated triggers effects and differences between traditional and digital aggression okeeffe clarkepearson council on communications and media 2011 wonglo and bullock 2011 stated that digital aggression is a form of online peer aggression which can be as damaging as any form of facetoface aggression starcevic and aboujaoude 2015 stated that as the usage of the internet has increased availability and speed of communication has also expanded as a result of this several new psychological disorders have been discovered and many crimes are now more easily committed due to newfound digital aggression aboujaoude and starcevic 2015 stated that with the increasing popularity of the internet it has been found that there are new and different mental health issues that have come to light these issues can stem from cyber aggression risks of overexposure to information and the glorification of overtly sexual or violent acts aboujaoude starcevic 2015 the advancements of telecommunication technologies have increased the widespread use of social media applications nowadays social media networks have billions of users and uncountableshared media content and they provide easy access to browse and share different content digital aggression is presented as a negative use of social media networks especially when users post and share inappropriate content to harm others in public or private settings cook williams guerra tuthill 2007 zweig dank lachman yahner 2013 traditional 3 aggression acts such as bullying and stalking have been reconstructed in a digital manner and names such as cyberbullying cyberstalking and online harassment have been used to describe these aggressive acts dooley pyzalski cross 2009 ito et al 2010 zweig dank lachman yahner 2013 today cyber aggression is considered one of the digital dilemmas due to the high psychological and emotional risks generated by the uncontrolled aggressive practices which can also lead to physical risks faryadi 2011 these risks could cause both victims and perpetrators to experience depression stress anxiety loneliness low academic performance and productivity eating disorders and even suicide baldry winkel 2003 mills et al 2004 hinduja patchin 2010 the literature provides many studies that could prove the effects of online aggression and how it could form serious threats thus many researchers recommend the use of education to spread awareness of these risks as well as how to prevent and treat them effectively starcevic aboujaoude 2015 cyberbullying is mistakenly understood as conflicts among school students through the use of the internet however the literature has shown that cyber aggressive acts could influence both adults and young people including school students college students and coworkers alzahrani 2015 kowalski limber agatston 2012 smith yoon 2013 in one study it was revealed that even adults could be at the risk of peer aggression a strong association between workplace bullying and subsequent depression suggests that bullying is an etiological factor for mental health problems the victims of bullying also seem to be at greater risk of cardiovascular disease kivimaki et al 2003 p779 4 these previous findings would make cyber aggression a global concern that should be taken seriously and not ignored due to its destructive psychological emotional and medical effects on people from different ages genders and cultures saudi arabia is considered by some one of the fastest developing countries in the middle east region the internet is provided at cheap rates and is available to everyone saudi citizens use the internet for social interaction and sharing information on a daily basis the use of smartphones is high due to the coverage of 3g and 4g networks in large cities and towns the recent statistic analysis shows that there are around 20 million internet users in saudi arabia and 14 million active social media users citc 2014 the social clinic 2015 cyber aggression is a new concept for many saudi social media users and most of them do not have a clear definition of it see pilot study in chapter 3 the current literature presents two studies that investigated cyberbullying and cyberstalking concepts in saudi arabia in one of these studies the author stated that the findings come in line with the current literature that consider cyberbullying as a global concern and can be a real risk to students and may cause them both emotional and physical harm alzahrani 2015 p23 in this study alzahrani 2015 proved the prevalence of cyberbullying and its risk in saudi arabia and proved the existing of some online aggressive acts that could be consider cyberstalking in the other study the analysis of collected quantitative data from 500 saudi participants indicated that more than 70 of the participants answered that they have never seen or heard about cyberbullying and with this high percentage saudi arabia ranked with the lowest awareness about cyber aggression among the selected 24 countries in the study ipsos global advisor 2011 5 due to the lack of research in the literature about cyber aggression in saudi arabia the researcher conducted a largerscale pilot study to explore the concept of cyber aggression in social media applications however all selected participants were active social media users from saudi arabia the study was designed to collect qualitative data throughout indepth interviews with saudi arabian students at the university of north texas unt the aim of the pilot study was to explore the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia as well as to understand the negative use of social media applications and the harmful information sharing practices the transcription of the recoded interviews led to 450 pages that were analyzed by different categories of codes and themes during the analysis process the researcher focused on the factors that could be related to the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression the pilot study concluded that cyber aggression and the inappropriate use and share of information were found due to lack of understanding lack of support and other cultural traditional and social aspects chapter 3 of this dissertation presents the pilot study its methodology data collection analysis and results purpose of the study this research was divided into two major stages in the first stage the main purpose was to understand cyber aggression in saudi arabia and how saudi social media users perceive and tolerate the concept in their society it was conducted to identify constructs and factors that could explain the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in different social media platforms with the goal of developing reliable scales these were used at the second stage three scales cyberbullying acceptance scale cyberstalking acceptance scale and wrong social media practices acceptance scale a total of 71 items were generated from the 6 pilot study though using a sample from saudi arabia acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression is thought to exist in other societies with similar cultural characteristics in other this methodology may be generalized across similar cultures the scales and items to measure them are discussed in chapter 3 and chapter 4 of this dissertation research problem the literature shows a strong relationship between facetoface and digital aggression and the generated physical and psychological harm that could affect people of all ages kowalski et al 2012 lange 2007 miller hufstedler 2009 olweus 1993 sabina 2010 whittaker kowalski 2015 past studies from different disciplines have focused on the causes and effects of aggression to prove its existence however there are no studies that developed scales with items to measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggressive acts in saudi arabia or in other parts of the world with similar cultural characteristics in the following six sections there is more deliberation of the cyber aggression dilemma related to the characteristics of saudi arabian culture in saudi arabia there is a lack of studies to describe digital aggression and its negative outcomes particularly among the saudi arabian social media community alzahrani 2015 stated that cyberbullying has got much attention globally but it has received little attention in developing countries such as saudi arabia especially from the education perspective thus addressing the problem in saudi arabia is necessary and may inform the research context in this area p18 after conducting the pilot study the researcher found that the lack of understanding about how many acts and their effects were cyber aggressive and the main reasons that could lead people to accept cyber aggression and behave aggressively see chapter 3 7 the majority of participants stated that cyber aggression acts are very noticeable among saudi social media users however they believe that people do not understand what is acceptable and not acceptable and most of the problems are caused by information sharing practices furthermore the lack of awareness and lack of immediate support were other factors that could increase the size of cyber aggression problem it was concluded that the concept of cyber aggression is new for the majority of social media users in saudi arabia people do not realize or understand the cyber aggression problems they could not recognize the serious consequences on adults adolescents and children thus society members chose to accept or tolerate them not realizing the effects of aggressive acts in 2010 the population of saudi arabia was 296 million and the number is expected to be 35 million by 2020 international monetary fund 2015 more than 50 of the total population is under 25 years murphy 2012 the last statistical report by the communication and information technology commission citc indicates that the number of internet users in saudi arabia is roughly 20 million citc 2014 the old statistic by globalwebindex 2012 indicates that there were around 9 million active social media users in saudi arabia however the number of social media users increased in recent years and reached around 14 million in early 2015 the social clinic 2015 in another report it was found that the majority of internet users in saudi arabia spent 239 hours social networking and 145 hours microblogging daily for a total of 384 hours of time spent online each day winkels et al 2013 p28 this could stress the importance of social media applications in saudi arabia although the social media has changed human interactions cyberbullying via social media was found in saudi arabia alzahrani 2015 8 cyberbullying rate in saudi arabia has increased compared with reuters global report in 2012 from 18 to about 27 the increase in cyberbullying rate might indicate a serious prevailing problem and requires further action despite the fact that these rates are still among the lowest rates globally alzahrani 2015 p23 yet cyber aggression is not well understood or documented in saudi arabia due to lack of studies in the literature lack of education and lack of understanding and awareness toward cyber aggression alzahrani 2015 ipsos global advisor 2011 pilot study in chapter 3 the literature has proven the side effects of digital aggression and how it can lead victims to harmful psychological problems mental illnesses suicidal thoughts and even suicide in severe cases baldry winkel 2003 mills et al 2004 hinduja patchin 2010 research findings have shown that people who become victims of cyber aggression face excessive stress in their life beebe 2010 in saudi arabia psychological problems are considered a type of stigma that should be hidden from society at the same time most of female patients cannot visit psychiatrists alone or without a guardian abdelwahid alshahrani 2011 alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin 2014 bassiony 2005 in many cases the victims and their families suffer without consultation or medical care because they do not want to reveal their problems hiding problems would make these issues more problematic when compared to other cultures the western world more developed countries etc the victims may find themselves forced to hide their problems and harmful symptoms from close family members friends and society often this is because they do not want to be labeled with names that they consider shameful such as unstable foolish or mentally ill at the same time victims do not want their problems to become worse and affect their social standing see chapter 3 one study found that the rate of depression in saudi arabia has increased in recent years and most general practitioners and medical doctors are not well prepared to diagnose depression 9 therefore it was recommended that the screening of depression should be implemented in primary care settings alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin 2014 p7 another study found that the excessive use of social media and isolation led high school students in riyadh to experience depression and highlevel anxiety alnezi 2014 however the author of this study did not discuss if cyber aggression was one of the triggers to these psychological problems none of the studies in the literature discussed the possible link between cyber aggression and psychological problems in saudi arabia in saudi society mixing between genders is not accepted in public places and women are required to be fully covered while they are in public to adhere to society values and traditions currently the internet is used as an important means for socializing sharing textual and visual information among different groups takes place despite the gender of users at the same time there is monitoring of social interactions on the internet but it is impossible to have full control of those interactions thus the massive interaction between million of social media users in saudi arabia is thought to include cyber aggression the increased level of interactions in todays social media applications along with many diverse societal cultural and traditional aspects could influence the behaviors of social media users and may lead to cyber aggression justifications it was found that men presented more aggression than women in saudi arabia which may affect the safety of individuals in saudi cyber sphere alzahrani 2015 this could be attributed to the nature of saudi arabian society given that it is a male dominated society alsalem 2005 in saudi arabia culture males are perceived as guardians responsible for maintaining cultural and traditional values thus the culturally biased gender differences could be a contributing factor in the increased cyber bullying by men toward women who use social media applications and may act out of the norms of 10 the society at large there is a need to understand cyber aggression and the related factors that may affect the social media behaviors acceptance and tolerance toward the digital aggression the literature and the pilot study revealed that the lack of understanding about legal consequences the absent of law enforcement and anonymity play a large role in increasing the level of online aggression among social media users akbulut eristi 2011 grigg 2012 pilot study in chapter 3 cyberbullying and cyberstalking acts such as spreading rumors posting personal and sensitive information in public or sharing humiliating videos or any information that could affect the social standing of the victim are regulated by the anticyber crime law however these laws are not well publicized in saudi arabia elnaim 2013 many people practice cyber aggressive acts without knowing the possible penalties and most of them believe that their acts are not considered crimes one of the participants from the pilot study was asked about the cyberbullying problems in saudi arabia and he stated it s a huge problem and its impacting people in a bad way and we should have an immediate response to whats happening now especially that we have people back home saudi arabia who are like addicted to social media and they are not educated about the rules of social media cyber crime law appendix d file 2167422070 p 221 the pilot study revealed that aggression is very noticeable in social media applications the high level of exposure affects people and they learn many of the negative practices from their peers in the absence of parent control the selfcontrol these aggressive acts become more acceptable and tolerable and this could be related to certain social aspects for example bandura 1978 1986 in his social learning theory and aggression explained that people learn from their observed surroundings thus many aggressive behaviors can be learned from watching and imitating others in social media people could encounter aggression in their daily activities with friends and unknown people via social media 11 aggressive behavior is based on the learning activation and application of aggressionrelated knowledge structures stored in memory such learning takes place through encounters with the physical and social world much learning occurs through observing real and functional characters or it may occur through online observation carnagey anderson bushman 2007 p491 in the pilot study participants affirmed the prevalence of cyber aggression and they believed that people learn from each other and through online observations the exposure to cyber aggression via social media applications on a daily basis could encourage cyber aggression acts therefore the researcher took these issues into carful consideration to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber aggression and all related factors importantly measuring the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance would help in understanding the size of the cyber aggression problem and how the aggressive social interactions could impact social media users and spread the cyber aggression in saudi arabia problem statement although the literature has shown the existence of digital aggression and its physiological effects measuring the acceptance of these aggressive acts via social media applications remains unexamined for the most part most of current scales in the literature are purposefully designed to study the occurrence of digital aggression such as evictimisation scale and ebullying scale lam li 2013 which were produced based on the aggression and victimization scale by orpinas and horne 2010 however these scales do not measure the acceptance of cyber aggression among social media users a number of the studies proved the prevalence of digital aggression the rates of its occurrence and its effects on adults and youth people beran li 2005 beran li 2008 dehue bolman vollink 2008 mishna khourykassabri gadalla daciuk 2012 however none of these studies investigated whether these online aggressive behaviors and acts might be socially accepted or tolerated or their circumstances 12 significance of the study hanewald 2008 states that although cyber aggression was found to cause many psychological problems that could lead to physical violence and crimes and that the educational community around the world has only made a small contribution p2 the literature has presented the prevalence of digital aggression and its associated side effects however measuring the acceptance and tolerance of these online aggressive acts and hostile behaviors is still undiscovered measuring cyber aggression through the use of social media applications would help to expand our knowledge about cyber aggression and discuss it from a new perspective in this study cyber aggression was investigated in a different way by measuring how acceptable it is to bully or stalk someone in the digital world at the same time measuring how people tolerate different cyber aggressive acts the literature lacks studies and descriptions about cyberbullying and cyberstalking in saudi culture there is a large demand to investigate the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia alzahrani 2015 concluded that further research using different types of methodologies are required to address the problem and investigate the impacts of cyberbullying on students learning and social life p24 moreover this study could provide a comprehensive understanding about the cyber aggression concept and new information to the literature about the saudi digital culture the study considered the dilemma of digital aggression and used the mixed methods approach by conducting a qualitative pilot study in its first stage and a quantitative approach in the second stage to create reliable and valid scales that can measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression including the acceptance of wrong practices of sharing aggressive information and media via social media applications the literature revealed that 13 aggression in the cyber sphere could lead to facetoface aggression physical harm and violence thus measuring cyber aggression would help in understanding the size of problem providing proper help and support and preventing possible future incidents and crimes understanding the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance could inform researchers educators parents and even managers in workplaces about the rate of cyber aggression and help in designing required educational programs to raise the level of awareness and providing the required support and help resources research questions the pilot study included a qualitative approach to collect descriptive data through a number of interviews with selected participants the researcher used openended questions to explore the cyber aggression phenomena expansively the researcher arranged the interview questions in six sections see appendix c the researcher used then a survey of social media users in saudi arabia as stated previously the purpose of this research is to develop an instrument that could measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of online aggressive practices as well as measuring the negative use and share of information via social media applications to answer the following research questions q1 what factors could explain cyber aggression via social media applications in saudi arabia q2 to what extent do social media users in saudi arabia accept and tolerate cyber aggression q3 to what extent do informationsharing practices affect social media users in saudi arabia 14 limitations of the study this study focused on the phenomenon of cyber aggression the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggressive acts data were collected of mainly saudi arabian social media users the researcher selected saudi arabian students who live in the dallasfort worth area to participate in the initial interviews pilot study therefore they were in the united states and were more aware of the cyber aggression concept from their personal contacts or their children s schools the interviews revealed that the participants had heard about cyber aggression and strongly believed that people in saudi arabia would not be familiar with the concept because saudi society ignores it and there is no interest in schools or tv media to increase general awareness of this type of aggression among the general society the pilot study cannot affirm that people in saudi arabia have never heard about cyber aggression another related issue is that the researcher conducted the exploratory pilot study to collect the participants understandings and meanings of cyber aggression nevertheless the researcher used a small sample size of saudi students 14 participants who live in the united states this is a limitation that could affect the items in the scales because the researcher has assumptions based on the views of people who live outside saudi arabia and had the chance to understand the concepts of cyber aggression these scales were developed based on participants understanding of the concept of cyber aggression and it is predictable that saudi social media users who live in saudi arabia and have never heard about cyber aggression would have different understandings and meanings of this concept the designed scales were developed based on the analysis of collected qualitative data via the interviews with saudi social media users thus the scales items would be suitable to measure cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in other countries with similar cultural views 15 notably what is acceptable or tolerable in the some cultures may be an unsuitable act in the saudi culture there is a need for some modifications on these developed scales to make them reliable and valid across all cultures though generalization may be possible across others that are similar the pilot study provided a comprehensive picture of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and then the researcher focused on examining the reliability of scales and tried to increase their reliability values by removing irrelevant items there is a need for more studies to test these developed scales and increase their reliability and examine them with larger different samples definition of terms this section provides a table at the end defines the different terms in this dissertation it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation of main terms related to the cyber aggression and developed scales there is also a need to understand the meaning of acceptability and tolerability because the literature shows that people refuse to accept negative acts and they hide them or find another name to justify their actions spaniol gagne 1997 terms of cyber aggression cyberbullying is the conscious deliberate repeated and hostile behavior by one or more people who intend to harm others via the use of technology hinduja patchin 2014 for example calling disrespectful names sending unwanted messages spreading rumors posting humiliating information or spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings cyberstalking is a course of online conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear hanewald 2008 for examples sending aggressive massages 16 posting false information and spreading nasty rumors or defamations that all jeopardize victims social status personal and professional relationships reputation and future wrong social media practices include the unsafe use of social media applications by sharing personal information and sensitive information ignoring privacy settings spreading false information ignoring cyber policies etc however personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information thus it is a multidimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity personal pictures private videos family issues health issues finical issues future plans and secrets could be personal and sensitive information acceptability and tolerability spaniol and gagne 1997 defined acceptance as a process that involves both emotional as well as cognitive aspects of ourselves it is not simply a matter of making a decision it involves working out this decision emotionally and through our actions p75 they added that acceptance means seeing and acknowledging all the various aspects of oneself without devaluing oneself p75 in this vine people may practice aggression without recognizing it as a harmful act that could lead to that type of negative acceptance spaniol and gagne 1997 stated that acceptance means seeing ourselves as we are without judging ourselves p76 it could denote that people may do what they do without thinking or judging their acts whether they harm others or not it was mentioned that acceptance needs support from others because supporting the act would make it acceptable to many people in society and this acceptance would lead to more acceptance for both those who do the act as well as those who observe it anthony 1993 spaniol gagne 1997 this type of support could play a role in expanding the size of acceptability spaniol and gagne 1997 stated that the process of acceptance is a process 17 with people and events we are not alone in how we experience and respond to our life p76 spreading acceptance to members of society is complex because it is a process that may take a long time it involves all of us our mind our body our emotions and our behavior spaniol gagne 1997 p77 it was declared that acceptance is a process that would make a person accept an act without devaluing it and this acceptance could happen at ones own discretion without any force at the same time a person may deal with the act without accepting it in other words a person may tolerate the act without totally accepting it or rejecting it from a psychology perspective tolerance is defined as a fair objective and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions practices race religion nationality etc differ from ones own freedom from bigotry fish 2014 para3 the pilot study revealed that some participants would not accept the practice of cyber aggression but they would tolerate it participants were able to justify cyber aggression while at the same time they would object the justification a number of participants in the pilot study believed that social media users in saudi arabia may act aggressively but they may not realize that their acts are aggressive when the society ignores these acts fatany 2013 stated that most of bullying cases in schools are ignored and this could be an alarming sign that when these acts are not considered important people may try to accept or justify and tolerate them to differentiate between acceptance and tolerance fish 2014 stated that acceptance is a persons assent to the reality of a situation recognizing a process or condition often a negative or uncomfortable situation without attempting to change it protest or exit fish 2014 para4 on the other hand tolerating does not necessarily mean accepting because tolerance is only possible when some action or practice is objectionable to us but we have 18 overriding reasons to allow that action or practice to take place powell clarke 2013 p3 they added that when we decide to tolerate an action or a practice we decide to forego an opportunity to interfere in some instance of that activity or practice powell clarke 2013 p3 this means that people may tolerate cyber aggressive acts for some reasons without accepting them or they may accept actions without seeing any objection to refuse them acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance if a sign of tolerance is a feeling of i can live with x behavior religion race culture etc acceptance moves beyond that in the direction of x is ok you can tolerate something without accepting it but you cannot accept something without tolerating it for example when a son or daughter tells a parent about an unwelcome career choice marital partner or sexual identity he or she wants that information not just to be tolerated but to be accepted fish 2014 para6 in this dissertation the term acceptance was used to determine whether social media users in saudi arabia accept cyber aggression or if they may tolerate it under certain circumstances the pilot study revealed that participants have a level of toleration towards cyber aggression due to a number of factors see chapter 3 it is logical that accepting cyber aggression could be more severe than tolerating it however tolerating cyber aggression does not make it less harmful than accepting it when problems are ignored or left without solutions they may lead to severe psychological and emotional damages as well as a high crime rate alamri 2015 fatany 2013 the following table provides definitions for the most significant terms used in this dissertation it is critical to define these terms in advance in order to create a proper literature review about the selected topic in this research 19 table 1 definition of terms terms

she is in public it is also known as a thick opaque and loose fitting cloak that covers the whole body the literature review in chapter 2 provides a comprehensive picture that shows the enormous amount of human interaction and media content in current social media sphere moreover it explains the risk of cyber aggression that could be generated by the inappropriate sharing of information and covers the different types of cyber aggression activities risks and effects, chapter  introduction background the literature revealed that the number of internet and social media users increases at a high rate due to advancements in information technology today internet users act as information seekers generators and distributors thus the internet has become more dynamic where its users collaborate to increase knowledge sharing however this makes the amount of human interaction immeasurable and the volume of usergenerated content hard to be both controlled and monitored the high volume of information sharing could be a positive source of information when internet communities collaborate to share valuable information unfortunately the cyber sphere is an open environment that allows all types of people to access it and share diverse information therefore negative practices such as bullying stalking blackmailing harassment and other aggressive acts have been found in the digital world and form real threats for both adult and young users starcevic aboujaoude  advancements in technology create a new virtual life for people to communicate and share information without restrictions of time and location these technological tools were designed to increase the level of social interaction between people everywhere and to allow knowledge sharing that could be accessible to everyone and at any time social media applications have changed the way of communication from facetoface screentoscreen or devicetodevice communications although the technological revolution has increased the level of social interaction by sharing knowledge and valuable information these technological tools could be used to benefit the community or harm its users shullich  starcevic aboujaoude   social media users are able to create different media content such as textual visual and video people can publicly share their information or privately via private social groups however sharing information over the internet and via social media networks is not totally protected from cyber risks recently researchers revealed that traditional aggression could be transferred to the digital world and present similar or worse psychological impacts on victims dooley pyzalski cross  ito et al  zweig dank lachman yahner  researchers have investigated triggers effects and differences between traditional and digital aggression okeeffe clarkepearson council on communications and media  wonglo and bullock  stated that digital aggression is a form of online peer aggression which can be as damaging as any form of facetoface aggression starcevic and aboujaoude  stated that as the usage of the internet has increased availability and speed of communication has also expanded as a result of this several new psychological disorders have been discovered and many crimes are now more easily committed due to newfound digital aggression aboujaoude and starcevic  stated that with the increasing popularity of the internet it has been found that there are new and different mental health issues that have come to light these issues can stem from cyber aggression risks of overexposure to information and the glorification of overtly sexual or violent acts aboujaoude starcevic  the advancements of telecommunication technologies have increased the widespread use of social media applications nowadays social media networks have billions of users and uncountableshared media content and they provide easy access to browse and share different content digital aggression is presented as a negative use of social media networks especially when users post and share inappropriate content to harm others in public or private settings cook williams guerra tuthill  zweig dank lachman yahner  traditional  aggression acts such as bullying and stalking have been reconstructed in a digital manner and names such as cyberbullying cyberstalking and online harassment have been used to describe these aggressive acts dooley pyzalski cross  ito et al  zweig dank lachman yahner  today cyber aggression is considered one of the digital dilemmas due to the high psychological and emotional risks generated by the uncontrolled aggressive practices which can also lead to physical risks faryadi  these risks could cause both victims and perpetrators to experience depression stress anxiety loneliness low academic performance and productivity eating disorders and even suicide baldry winkel  mills et al  hinduja patchin  the literature provides many studies that could prove the effects of online aggression and how it could form serious threats thus many researchers recommend the use of education to spread awareness of these risks as well as how to prevent and treat them effectively starcevic aboujaoude  cyberbullying is mistakenly understood as conflicts among school students through the use of the internet however the literature has shown that cyber aggressive acts could influence both adults and young people including school students college students and coworkers alzahrani  kowalski limber agatston  smith yoon  in one study it was revealed that even adults could be at the risk of peer aggression a strong association between workplace bullying and subsequent depression suggests that bullying is an etiological factor for mental health problems the victims of bullying also seem to be at greater risk of cardiovascular disease kivimaki et al  p  these previous findings would make cyber aggression a global concern that should be taken seriously and not ignored due to its destructive psychological emotional and medical effects on people from different ages genders and cultures saudi arabia is considered by some one of the fastest developing countries in the middle east region the internet is provided at cheap rates and is available to everyone saudi citizens use the internet for social interaction and sharing information on a daily basis the use of smartphones is high due to the coverage of g and g networks in large cities and towns the recent statistic analysis shows that there are around  million internet users in saudi arabia and  million active social media users citc  the social clinic  cyber aggression is a new concept for many saudi social media users and most of them do not have a clear definition of it see pilot study in chapter  the current literature presents two studies that investigated cyberbullying and cyberstalking concepts in saudi arabia in one of these studies the author stated that the findings come in line with the current literature that consider cyberbullying as a global concern and can be a real risk to students and may cause them both emotional and physical harm alzahrani  p in this study alzahrani  proved the prevalence of cyberbullying and its risk in saudi arabia and proved the existing of some online aggressive acts that could be consider cyberstalking in the other study the analysis of collected quantitative data from  saudi participants indicated that more than  of the participants answered that they have never seen or heard about cyberbullying and with this high percentage saudi arabia ranked with the lowest awareness about cyber aggression among the selected  countries in the study ipsos global advisor   due to the lack of research in the literature about cyber aggression in saudi arabia the researcher conducted a largerscale pilot study to explore the concept of cyber aggression in social media applications however all selected participants were active social media users from saudi arabia the study was designed to collect qualitative data throughout indepth interviews with saudi arabian students at the university of north texas unt the aim of the pilot study was to explore the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia as well as to understand the negative use of social media applications and the harmful information sharing practices the transcription of the recoded interviews led to  pages that were analyzed by different categories of codes and themes during the analysis process the researcher focused on the factors that could be related to the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression the pilot study concluded that cyber aggression and the inappropriate use and share of information were found due to lack of understanding lack of support and other cultural traditional and social aspects chapter  of this dissertation presents the pilot study its methodology data collection analysis and results purpose of the study this research was divided into two major stages in the first stage the main purpose was to understand cyber aggression in saudi arabia and how saudi social media users perceive and tolerate the concept in their society it was conducted to identify constructs and factors that could explain the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in different social media platforms with the goal of developing reliable scales these were used at the second stage three scales cyberbullying acceptance scale cyberstalking acceptance scale and wrong social media practices acceptance scale a total of  items were generated from the  pilot study though using a sample from saudi arabia acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggression is thought to exist in other societies with similar cultural characteristics in other this methodology may be generalized across similar cultures the scales and items to measure them are discussed in chapter  and chapter  of this dissertation research problem the literature shows a strong relationship between facetoface and digital aggression and the generated physical and psychological harm that could affect people of all ages kowalski et al  lange  miller hufstedler  olweus  sabina  whittaker kowalski  past studies from different disciplines have focused on the causes and effects of aggression to prove its existence however there are no studies that developed scales with items to measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggressive acts in saudi arabia or in other parts of the world with similar cultural characteristics in the following six sections there is more deliberation of the cyber aggression dilemma related to the characteristics of saudi arabian culture in saudi arabia there is a lack of studies to describe digital aggression and its negative outcomes particularly among the saudi arabian social media community alzahrani  stated that cyberbullying has got much attention globally but it has received little attention in developing countries such as saudi arabia especially from the education perspective thus addressing the problem in saudi arabia is necessary and may inform the research context in this area p after conducting the pilot study the researcher found that the lack of understanding about how many acts and their effects were cyber aggressive and the main reasons that could lead people to accept cyber aggression and behave aggressively see chapter   the majority of participants stated that cyber aggression acts are very noticeable among saudi social media users however they believe that people do not understand what is acceptable and not acceptable and most of the problems are caused by information sharing practices furthermore the lack of awareness and lack of immediate support were other factors that could increase the size of cyber aggression problem it was concluded that the concept of cyber aggression is new for the majority of social media users in saudi arabia people do not realize or understand the cyber aggression problems they could not recognize the serious consequences on adults adolescents and children thus society members chose to accept or tolerate them not realizing the effects of aggressive acts in  the population of saudi arabia was  million and the number is expected to be  million by  international monetary fund  more than  of the total population is under  years murphy  the last statistical report by the communication and information technology commission citc indicates that the number of internet users in saudi arabia is roughly  million citc  the old statistic by globalwebindex  indicates that there were around  million active social media users in saudi arabia however the number of social media users increased in recent years and reached around  million in early  the social clinic  in another report it was found that the majority of internet users in saudi arabia spent  hours social networking and  hours microblogging daily for a total of  hours of time spent online each day winkels et al  p this could stress the importance of social media applications in saudi arabia although the social media has changed human interactions cyberbullying via social media was found in saudi arabia alzahrani   cyberbullying rate in saudi arabia has increased compared with reuters global report in  from  to about  the increase in cyberbullying rate might indicate a serious prevailing problem and requires further action despite the fact that these rates are still among the lowest rates globally alzahrani  p yet cyber aggression is not well understood or documented in saudi arabia due to lack of studies in the literature lack of education and lack of understanding and awareness toward cyber aggression alzahrani  ipsos global advisor  pilot study in chapter  the literature has proven the side effects of digital aggression and how it can lead victims to harmful psychological problems mental illnesses suicidal thoughts and even suicide in severe cases baldry winkel  mills et al  hinduja patchin  research findings have shown that people who become victims of cyber aggression face excessive stress in their life beebe  in saudi arabia psychological problems are considered a type of stigma that should be hidden from society at the same time most of female patients cannot visit psychiatrists alone or without a guardian abdelwahid alshahrani  alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin  bassiony  in many cases the victims and their families suffer without consultation or medical care because they do not want to reveal their problems hiding problems would make these issues more problematic when compared to other cultures the western world more developed countries etc the victims may find themselves forced to hide their problems and harmful symptoms from close family members friends and society often this is because they do not want to be labeled with names that they consider shameful such as unstable foolish or mentally ill at the same time victims do not want their problems to become worse and affect their social standing see chapter  one study found that the rate of depression in saudi arabia has increased in recent years and most general practitioners and medical doctors are not well prepared to diagnose depression  therefore it was recommended that the screening of depression should be implemented in primary care settings alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin  p another study found that the excessive use of social media and isolation led high school students in riyadh to experience depression and highlevel anxiety alnezi  however the author of this study did not discuss if cyber aggression was one of the triggers to these psychological problems none of the studies in the literature discussed the possible link between cyber aggression and psychological problems in saudi arabia in saudi society mixing between genders is not accepted in public places and women are required to be fully covered while they are in public to adhere to society values and traditions currently the internet is used as an important means for socializing sharing textual and visual information among different groups takes place despite the gender of users at the same time there is monitoring of social interactions on the internet but it is impossible to have full control of those interactions thus the massive interaction between million of social media users in saudi arabia is thought to include cyber aggression the increased level of interactions in todays social media applications along with many diverse societal cultural and traditional aspects could influence the behaviors of social media users and may lead to cyber aggression justifications it was found that men presented more aggression than women in saudi arabia which may affect the safety of individuals in saudi cyber sphere alzahrani  this could be attributed to the nature of saudi arabian society given that it is a male dominated society alsalem  in saudi arabia culture males are perceived as guardians responsible for maintaining cultural and traditional values thus the culturally biased gender differences could be a contributing factor in the increased cyber bullying by men toward women who use social media applications and may act out of the norms of  the society at large there is a need to understand cyber aggression and the related factors that may affect the social media behaviors acceptance and tolerance toward the digital aggression the literature and the pilot study revealed that the lack of understanding about legal consequences the absent of law enforcement and anonymity play a large role in increasing the level of online aggression among social media users akbulut eristi  grigg  pilot study in chapter  cyberbullying and cyberstalking acts such as spreading rumors posting personal and sensitive information in public or sharing humiliating videos or any information that could affect the social standing of the victim are regulated by the anticyber crime law however these laws are not well publicized in saudi arabia elnaim  many people practice cyber aggressive acts without knowing the possible penalties and most of them believe that their acts are not considered crimes one of the participants from the pilot study was asked about the cyberbullying problems in saudi arabia and he stated it s a huge problem and its impacting people in a bad way and we should have an immediate response to whats happening now especially that we have people back home saudi arabia who are like addicted to social media and they are not educated about the rules of social media cyber crime law appendix d file  p  the pilot study revealed that aggression is very noticeable in social media applications the high level of exposure affects people and they learn many of the negative practices from their peers in the absence of parent control the selfcontrol these aggressive acts become more acceptable and tolerable and this could be related to certain social aspects for example bandura   in his social learning theory and aggression explained that people learn from their observed surroundings thus many aggressive behaviors can be learned from watching and imitating others in social media people could encounter aggression in their daily activities with friends and unknown people via social media  aggressive behavior is based on the learning activation and application of aggressionrelated knowledge structures stored in memory such learning takes place through encounters with the physical and social world much learning occurs through observing real and functional characters or it may occur through online observation carnagey anderson bushman  p in the pilot study participants affirmed the prevalence of cyber aggression and they believed that people learn from each other and through online observations the exposure to cyber aggression via social media applications on a daily basis could encourage cyber aggression acts therefore the researcher took these issues into carful consideration to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber aggression and all related factors importantly measuring the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance would help in understanding the size of the cyber aggression problem and how the aggressive social interactions could impact social media users and spread the cyber aggression in saudi arabia problem statement although the literature has shown the existence of digital aggression and its physiological effects measuring the acceptance of these aggressive acts via social media applications remains unexamined for the most part most of current scales in the literature are purposefully designed to study the occurrence of digital aggression such as evictimisation scale and ebullying scale lam li  which were produced based on the aggression and victimization scale by orpinas and horne  however these scales do not measure the acceptance of cyber aggression among social media users a number of the studies proved the prevalence of digital aggression the rates of its occurrence and its effects on adults and youth people beran li  beran li  dehue bolman vollink  mishna khourykassabri gadalla daciuk  however none of these studies investigated whether these online aggressive behaviors and acts might be socially accepted or tolerated or their circumstances  significance of the study hanewald  states that although cyber aggression was found to cause many psychological problems that could lead to physical violence and crimes and that the educational community around the world has only made a small contribution p the literature has presented the prevalence of digital aggression and its associated side effects however measuring the acceptance and tolerance of these online aggressive acts and hostile behaviors is still undiscovered measuring cyber aggression through the use of social media applications would help to expand our knowledge about cyber aggression and discuss it from a new perspective in this study cyber aggression was investigated in a different way by measuring how acceptable it is to bully or stalk someone in the digital world at the same time measuring how people tolerate different cyber aggressive acts the literature lacks studies and descriptions about cyberbullying and cyberstalking in saudi culture there is a large demand to investigate the concept of cyber aggression in saudi arabia alzahrani  concluded that further research using different types of methodologies are required to address the problem and investigate the impacts of cyberbullying on students learning and social life p moreover this study could provide a comprehensive understanding about the cyber aggression concept and new information to the literature about the saudi digital culture the study considered the dilemma of digital aggression and used the mixed methods approach by conducting a qualitative pilot study in its first stage and a quantitative approach in the second stage to create reliable and valid scales that can measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of cyber aggression including the acceptance of wrong practices of sharing aggressive information and media via social media applications the literature revealed that  aggression in the cyber sphere could lead to facetoface aggression physical harm and violence thus measuring cyber aggression would help in understanding the size of problem providing proper help and support and preventing possible future incidents and crimes understanding the level of cyber aggression acceptance and tolerance could inform researchers educators parents and even managers in workplaces about the rate of cyber aggression and help in designing required educational programs to raise the level of awareness and providing the required support and help resources research questions the pilot study included a qualitative approach to collect descriptive data through a number of interviews with selected participants the researcher used openended questions to explore the cyber aggression phenomena expansively the researcher arranged the interview questions in six sections see appendix c the researcher used then a survey of social media users in saudi arabia as stated previously the purpose of this research is to develop an instrument that could measure the level of acceptability and tolerability of online aggressive practices as well as measuring the negative use and share of information via social media applications to answer the following research questions q what factors could explain cyber aggression via social media applications in saudi arabia q to what extent do social media users in saudi arabia accept and tolerate cyber aggression q to what extent do informationsharing practices affect social media users in saudi arabia  limitations of the study this study focused on the phenomenon of cyber aggression the acceptance and tolerance of cyber aggressive acts data were collected of mainly saudi arabian social media users the researcher selected saudi arabian students who live in the dallasfort worth area to participate in the initial interviews pilot study therefore they were in the united states and were more aware of the cyber aggression concept from their personal contacts or their children s schools the interviews revealed that the participants had heard about cyber aggression and strongly believed that people in saudi arabia would not be familiar with the concept because saudi society ignores it and there is no interest in schools or tv media to increase general awareness of this type of aggression among the general society the pilot study cannot affirm that people in saudi arabia have never heard about cyber aggression another related issue is that the researcher conducted the exploratory pilot study to collect the participants understandings and meanings of cyber aggression nevertheless the researcher used a small sample size of saudi students  participants who live in the united states this is a limitation that could affect the items in the scales because the researcher has assumptions based on the views of people who live outside saudi arabia and had the chance to understand the concepts of cyber aggression these scales were developed based on participants understanding of the concept of cyber aggression and it is predictable that saudi social media users who live in saudi arabia and have never heard about cyber aggression would have different understandings and meanings of this concept the designed scales were developed based on the analysis of collected qualitative data via the interviews with saudi social media users thus the scales items would be suitable to measure cyber aggression in saudi arabia and in other countries with similar cultural views  notably what is acceptable or tolerable in the some cultures may be an unsuitable act in the saudi culture there is a need for some modifications on these developed scales to make them reliable and valid across all cultures though generalization may be possible across others that are similar the pilot study provided a comprehensive picture of cyber aggression in saudi arabia and then the researcher focused on examining the reliability of scales and tried to increase their reliability values by removing irrelevant items there is a need for more studies to test these developed scales and increase their reliability and examine them with larger different samples definition of terms this section provides a table at the end defines the different terms in this dissertation it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation of main terms related to the cyber aggression and developed scales there is also a need to understand the meaning of acceptability and tolerability because the literature shows that people refuse to accept negative acts and they hide them or find another name to justify their actions spaniol gagne  terms of cyber aggression cyberbullying is the conscious deliberate repeated and hostile behavior by one or more people who intend to harm others via the use of technology hinduja patchin  for example calling disrespectful names sending unwanted messages spreading rumors posting humiliating information or spreading embarrassing videos and pictures that cause uncomfortable feelings cyberstalking is a course of online conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear hanewald  for examples sending aggressive massages  posting false information and spreading nasty rumors or defamations that all jeopardize victims social status personal and professional relationships reputation and future wrong social media practices include the unsafe use of social media applications by sharing personal information and sensitive information ignoring privacy settings spreading false information ignoring cyber policies etc however personal information depends on the personal judgment of the sensitivity level of the information thus it is a multidimensional with varying degrees of sensitivity personal pictures private videos family issues health issues finical issues future plans and secrets could be personal and sensitive information acceptability and tolerability spaniol and gagne  defined acceptance as a process that involves both emotional as well as cognitive aspects of ourselves it is not simply a matter of making a decision it involves working out this decision emotionally and through our actions p they added that acceptance means seeing and acknowledging all the various aspects of oneself without devaluing oneself p in this vine people may practice aggression without recognizing it as a harmful act that could lead to that type of negative acceptance spaniol and gagne  stated that acceptance means seeing ourselves as we are without judging ourselves p it could denote that people may do what they do without thinking or judging their acts whether they harm others or not it was mentioned that acceptance needs support from others because supporting the act would make it acceptable to many people in society and this acceptance would lead to more acceptance for both those who do the act as well as those who observe it anthony  spaniol gagne  this type of support could play a role in expanding the size of acceptability spaniol and gagne  stated that the process of acceptance is a process  with people and events we are not alone in how we experience and respond to our life p spreading acceptance to members of society is complex because it is a process that may take a long time it involves all of us our mind our body our emotions and our behavior spaniol gagne  p it was declared that acceptance is a process that would make a person accept an act without devaluing it and this acceptance could happen at ones own discretion without any force at the same time a person may deal with the act without accepting it in other words a person may tolerate the act without totally accepting it or rejecting it from a psychology perspective tolerance is defined as a fair objective and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions practices race religion nationality etc differ from ones own freedom from bigotry fish  para the pilot study revealed that some participants would not accept the practice of cyber aggression but they would tolerate it participants were able to justify cyber aggression while at the same time they would object the justification a number of participants in the pilot study believed that social media users in saudi arabia may act aggressively but they may not realize that their acts are aggressive when the society ignores these acts fatany  stated that most of bullying cases in schools are ignored and this could be an alarming sign that when these acts are not considered important people may try to accept or justify and tolerate them to differentiate between acceptance and tolerance fish  stated that acceptance is a persons assent to the reality of a situation recognizing a process or condition often a negative or uncomfortable situation without attempting to change it protest or exit fish  para on the other hand tolerating does not necessarily mean accepting because tolerance is only possible when some action or practice is objectionable to us but we have  overriding reasons to allow that action or practice to take place powell clarke  p they added that when we decide to tolerate an action or a practice we decide to forego an opportunity to interfere in some instance of that activity or practice powell clarke  p this means that people may tolerate cyber aggressive acts for some reasons without accepting them or they may accept actions without seeing any objection to refuse them acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance if a sign of tolerance is a feeling of i can live with x behavior religion race culture etc acceptance moves beyond that in the direction of x is ok you can tolerate something without accepting it but you cannot accept something without tolerating it for example when a son or daughter tells a parent about an unwelcome career choice marital partner or sexual identity he or she wants that information not just to be tolerated but to be accepted fish  para in this dissertation the term acceptance was used to determine whether social media users in saudi arabia accept cyber aggression or if they may tolerate it under certain circumstances the pilot study revealed that participants have a level of toleration towards cyber aggression due to a number of factors see chapter  it is logical that accepting cyber aggression could be more severe than tolerating it however tolerating cyber aggression does not make it less harmful than accepting it when problems are ignored or left without solutions they may lead to severe psychological and emotional damages as well as a high crime rate alamri  fatany  the following table provides definitions for the most significant terms used in this dissertation it is critical to define these terms in advance in order to create a proper literature review about the selected topic in this research  table  definition of terms terms definitions cyber aggression any

in the follow six section there is more deliber of the cyber aggress dilemma relat to the characterist of saudi arabian cultur in saudi arabia there is a lack of studi to describ digit aggress and it neg outcom particularli among the saudi arabian social media commun alzahrani state that cyberbulli ha got much attent global but it ha receiv littl attent in develop countri such as saudi arabia especi from the educ perspect thu address the problem in saudi arabia is necessari and may inform the research context in thi area p after conduct the pilot studi the research found that the lack of

furthermor the lack of awar and lack of immedi support were other factor that could increas the size of cyber aggress problem it wa conclud that the concept of cyber aggress is new for the major of social media user in saudi arabia peopl do not realiz or understand the cyber aggress problem they could not recogn the seriou consequ on adult adolesc and children thu societi member chose to accept

even suicid in sever case baldri winkel mill et al hinduja patchin research find have shown that peopl who becom victim of cyber aggress face excess stress in their life beeb in saudi arabia psycholog

often thi is becaus they do not want to be label with name that they consid shame such as unstabl foolish or mental ill at the same time victim do not want their problem to becom wors and affect their

conduct the exploratori pilot studi to collect the particip understand and mean of cyber aggress nevertheless the research use a small sampl size of saudi student particip who live in the unit state thi is a limit that could affect the item in the scale becaus the research ha assumpt base on the view of peopl who live outsid saudi arabia and had the chanc to understand the concept of cyber

research focus on the factor that could be relat to the accept and toler of cyber aggress the pilot studi conclud that cyber aggress and the inappropri use and share of inform were found due to lack of understand lack of support and other cultur tradit and social aspect chapter of thi dissert present the pilot studi it methodolog data collect analysi and result purpos of the studi thi research wa divid into two major stage in the first stage the main purpos wa to understand cyber aggress in saudi arabia and how saudi social medium user perceiv and toler the concept in their societi it wa

exist howev there are no studi that develop scale with item to measur the level of accept and toler of cyber aggress act in saudi arabia or in other part of the world with similar cultur characterist in the follow six section there is more deliber of the cyber aggress dilemma relat to the characterist of saudi arabian cultur in saudi arabia there is a lack of studi to describ digit aggress and it neg outcom particularli among the saudi arabian social medium commun alzahrani state that cyberbulli ha got much attent global but it ha receiv littl attent in develop countri such a saudi arabia especi from the educ perspect thu address the problem in saudi arabia is necessari and may inform the research context in thi area p after conduct the pilot studi the research found that the lack of understand about how mani act and their effect were cyber aggress and the main reason that could lead peopl to accept cyber aggress and behav aggress see chapter the major of particip state that cyber aggress act are veri notic among saudi social medium user howev they believ that peopl do not understand what is accept and not accept and most of the problem are caus by inform share practic furthermor the lack of awar and lack of immedi support were other factor that could increas the size of cyber aggress problem it wa conclud that the concept of cyber aggress is new for the major of social medium user in saudi arabia peopl do not realiz or understand the cyber aggress problem they could not recogn the seriou consequ on adult adolesc and child thu societi member chose to accept or toler them not realiz the effect of aggress act in the popul of saudi arabia wa million and the number is expect to be million by intern monetari fund more than of the total popul is under year murphi

of social medium applic in saudi arabia although the social medium ha chang human interact cyberbulli via social medium wa found in saudi arabia alzahrani cyberbulli rate in saudi arabia ha increas compar with reuter global report in from to about the increas in cyberbulli rate might indic a seriou prevail problem and requir further action despit the fact that these rate are still among the lowest rate global alzahrani p yet cyber aggress is not well understood or document in saudi arabia due to lack of studi in the literatur lack of educ and lack of understand and awar toward cyber aggress alzahrani ipso global advisor pilot studi in chapter the literatur ha proven the side effect of digit aggress and how it can lead victim to harm psycholog problem mental ill suicid thought and even suicid in sever case baldri winkel mill et al hinduja patchin research find have shown that peopl who becom victim of cyber aggress face excess stress in their life beeb in saudi arabia psycholog problem are consid a type of stigma that should be hidden from societi at the same time most of femal patient cannot visit psychiatrist alon or without a guardian abdelwahid alshahrani alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin bassioni in mani case the victim and their famili suffer without consult or medic care becaus they do not want to reveal their problem hide problem would make these issu more problemat when compar to other cultur the western world more develop countri etc the victim may find themselv forc to hide their problem and harm symptom from close famili member friend and societi often thi is becaus they do not want to be label with name that they consid shame such a unstabl foolish or mental ill at the same time victim do not want their problem to becom wors and affect their social stand see chapter one studi found that the rate of depress in saudi arabia ha increas in recent year and most gener practition and medic doctor are not well prepar to diagnos depress therefor it wa recommend that the screen of depress should be implement in primari care set alqadhi rahman farwana imad addin p anoth studi found that the excess use of social medium and isol led high school student in riyadh to experi depress and highlevel anxieti alnezi howev the author of thi studi did not discus if cyber aggress wa one of the trigger to these psycholog problem none of the studi in the literatur discus the possibl link between cyber aggress and psycholog problem in saudi arabia in saudi societi mix between gender is not accept in public place and woman are requir to be fulli cover while they are in public to adher to societi valu and tradit current the internet is use a an import mean for social share textual and visual inform among differ group take place despit the gender of

arabia is thought to includ cyber aggress the increas level of interact in today social medium applic along with mani diver societ cultur and tradit aspect could influenc the behavior of social medium user and may lead to cyber aggress justif it wa found that men present more aggress than woman in saudi arabia which may affect the safeti of individu in saudi cyber sphere alzahrani thi could be attribut to the natur of saudi arabian societi given that it is a male domin societi alsalem in saudi arabia cultur male are perceiv a guardian respons for maintain cultur and tradit valu thu the

understand cyber aggress and the relat factor that may affect the social medium behavior accept and toler toward the digit aggress the literatur and the pilot studi reveal that the lack of understand

research conduct the exploratori pilot studi to collect the particip understand and mean of cyber aggress nevertheless the research use a small sampl size of saudi student particip who live in the unit state thi is a limit that could affect the item in the scale becaus the research ha assumpt base on the view of peopl who live outsid saudi arabia and had the chanc to understand the concept of cyber aggress these scale were develop base on particip understand of the concept of cyber aggress and it is predict that saudi social medium user who live in saudi arabia and have never heard about cyber aggress would have differ understand and mean of thi concept the design scale were develop base on the analysi of collect qualit data via the interview with saudi social medium user thu the scale item would be suitabl to measur cyber aggress in saudi arabia and in other countri with similar cultur view notabl what is accept or toler in the some cultur may be an unsuit act in the saudi cultur there is a need for some modif on these develop scale to make them reliabl and valid across all cultur though gener may be possibl across other that are similar the pilot studi provid a comprehens pictur of cyber aggress in saudi arabia and then the research focus on examin the reliabl of scale and tri to increas their reliabl valu by remov irrelev item there is a need for more studi

to provid a comprehens explan of main term relat to the cyber aggress and develop scale there is also a need to understand the mean of accept and toler becaus the literatur show that peopl refus to

practic race religion nation etc differ from one own freedom from bigotri fish para the pilot studi reveal that some particip would not accept the practic of cyber aggress but they would toler it particip were abl to justifi cyber aggress while at the same time they would object the justif a number of particip in the pilot studi believ that social medium user in saudi arabia may act aggress but they may not realiz that their act are aggress when the societi ignor these act fatani state that most of bulli case in school are ignor and thi could be an alarm sign that when these act are not consid import peopl may tri to accept or justifi and toler them to differenti between accept and toler fish state that accept is a person assent to the realiti of a situat recogn a process or condit often a neg or uncomfort situat without attempt to chang it protest or exit fish para on the other hand toler doe not necessarili mean accept becaus toler is onli possibl when some action or practic is objection to u but we have overrid reason to allow that action or practic to take place powel clark p they ad that when we decid to toler an action or a practic we decid to forego an opportun to

refus them accept goe a step beyond toler if a sign of toler is a feel of i can live with x behavior religion race cultur etc accept move beyond that in the direct of x is ok you can toler someth without accept it but you cannot accept someth without toler it for exampl when a son or daughter tell a parent about an unwelcom career choic marit partner or sexual ident he or she want that inform not just to be toler but to be accept fish para in thi dissert the term accept wa use to determin whether social medium user in saudi arabia accept cyber aggress or if they may toler it under certain circumst the pilot studi reveal that particip have a level of toler toward cyber aggress due to a number of factor see chapter it is logic that accept cyber aggress could be more sever than toler it

8,"CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION When I first began this dissertation, it was from the perspective of wanting to know whether the relationships between Jim Jones and his followers started out as cognitive authority (CA) relationships. As I got further into my research, I became more interested in modeling cognitive authority relationships as a means of identifying it in any situation. My intention was to use the known to reveal the unknown by analyzing situations where information seekers solicited advice from someone. After I analyzed the data of known cognitive authority relationships, I examined the results to see if they could be conveyed in a concise manner. Taking future research possibilities into consideration, I wondered if the results could also be easily compared to similar studies. While the results could be compared to other studies that used linguistic analysis, it did not appear that this could be done in a concise manner (i.e., lengthy explanation would have been required). I began to focus my efforts on developing an instrument that would facilitate modeling the results of my linguistic analysis. As development of the instrument proceeded, it grew into a classification system that not only could be used to model the word usage patterns of those involved in a cognitive authority relationship, but any relationship where the parties’ word usage patterns can be analyzed. I came to the realization that my dissertation had evolved into three parts; any one of the parts could have possibly existed alone as a single dissertation. With the approval of my dissertation chairperson, I re-scoped my dissertation to exclude the Jonestown study and focused my efforts on developing an instrument to detect and model cognitive authority. The information presented in this paper is the result of the “re-1scoping”. As such, it includes the linguistic analysis of the known cognitive authority relationships and the development of the classification system as the modeling instrument. Future studies can be performed on Jonestown, Branch Davidian, and other group as studies and the classification system will afford the ability to readily compare the results. Information-seeking behavior is a mixture of activities and attitudes, oftentimes motivated by an individual’s need to make a decision. One underlying element of this mixture is cognitive authority – which sources (e.g., individuals, institutions, texts, etc.) can be trusted to fulfil the information needs? In order to gain insight into the dynamics of cognitive authority selection behavior, this study explored primary source text data that reflect selection in the mundaneness of life (advice column submissions and responses). First, linguistic analysis was used on the advice column data to reveal latent factors that the cognitive authority and the information seeker share that may have contributed to the selection of a cognitive authority. The results were used to develop a cognitive authority relationship detection and prediction model. The findings and implications of this study may provide a contribution to the body of work in the area of information literacy and information seeker behavior by revealing factors that information scientists can address to help meet information seekers’ needs. The focus of this study was on “what” a cognitive authority relationship consisted of rather than “why” the various factors existed. However, the reason for the factors presence is equally important and would be a good topic for future research. 2Statement of the Problem Patrick Wilson (1983) posed the question, “What leads us to seek second-hand knowledge, and to whom are we led?” (p. 10). To which he asserts that necessity is the motivation for the seeking and “…to whom we think know something we do not know” is the source to which we turn for the knowledge (Wilson, 1983, p.10). This second-hand source of knowledge is what Wilson refers to as “cognitive authority”. To explain how and why there seems to be a variety of kinds and amounts of information, as well as, perceived acceptable sources, one much examine, “…how they decide who knows what about what” (Wilson, 1983, p. 10). Examination of the literature reveals that there is a lack of quantitative studies that examine actual occurrences of cognitive authority selection where the outcome of that selection is known. The study utilized quantitative methods to reveal underlying factors that influence cognitive authority selection in every-day mundane life situation. The data used in the study was from a sampling of primary source data in the form of advice column submissions and responses (newspaper columns, blogs, and websites).  Contact information was not available for the authors of the advice column submissions, so there was no opportunity to contact the authors, determine the result of the advice, or fill in any missing information. Although the outcomes resulting from the advice column activity was not available, the data was appropriate for the study for two reasons. The first reason is that the advice column submissions were more typical of every-day life. The second reason is that the act of a submission author seeking advice from the columnist represented cognitive authority selection according to how Wilson describes it. The author must have thought the columnist knew something that he (the 3author) did not know.  Because of this, the advice columnists/bloggers and their respective information seekers were in cognitive authority relationships. The research made usage of the information that was available because exploration of the data had the potential of adding to the body of cognitive authority selection research. 4Purpose of the Study This quantitative study was designed to identify any underlying factors that contribute to cognitive authority ascription. The idea is that by analyzing known cognitive authority selections, better insight into the dynamics of the ascription process may be gained. Identifying the characteristics that the cognitive authority and the information seekers share, as well as, any factors that contribute to the cognitive authority ascription dynamic may lend some predictability of selection. The findings and implications of this study may also provide valuable information that can contribute to the area of information literacy by way of credible source selection training that can help meet information needs. It has the potential to assist information scientists to design information sources that are better suited to meet the target information users’ needs. Additionally, the findings in this study could be used to help law enforcement identify persons of interest who are likely to ascribe cognitive authority to a known unlawful party. Primary source data from advice columns were used. The occurrences of cognitive authority selection in every-day life tend to be less extreme and play out in simple ways such as asking a neighbor to recommend a lawn fertilizer or submitting a question to a blog or advice column. Hence advice column data represented CA ascription in everyday life. Even though the study was not be experimental, exploration of data from mundane circumstances provided a level of normalcy for the findings. 5The first goal of this study was to identify any linguistic, social, and psychological states that may have been shared by the cognitive authority and information seekers that may have facilitated their relationship. The findings were used to develop a linguistic model of a cognitive authority relationship. The study was designed to address four research questions. Research Questions This study attempts to answer the following questions: RQ1: Which linguistic patterns are common to both the cognitive authority (CAπ) and the information seeker (CAλ)? RQ2: Which linguistic patterns exists between the cognitive authority (CAπ) and the information seeker (CAλ)? RQ3: Which linguistic characteristics are exclusive to the cognitive authority (CAπ)? RQ4: Which linguistic patterns are exclusive to the information seeker (CAλ)? Limitations, Delimitations, and Assumptions of the Study Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC2015) software was used to provide qualitative analysis. One of the limitations of LIWC is that its analysis does not take into account context, “…make it unable to detect the contextual” (Fernández-Cabana, García-Caballero, Alves-Pérez, García-García, & Mateos, 2015, p.129). “The word ’mad,’ for example, is currently coded as an anger word. When people say things such 6as, “’I’m mad about him’ or ’He’s as mad as a hatter‘, the meaning and intent of their utterances will be miscoded” (Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010, p.30). In a study done by Kahn, Tobin, Massey, and Anderson (2007), it was found that LIWC’s inability to detect context was not sufficient enough to eliminate it as a measure of emotional expression (p. 281). Another limitation was that the data that was used were text or digital records. No actual humans with first-hand experience were interviewed who may be able to lend clarity or insight into the context in which the records were produced. A delimitation is that this study only considered statistically significant correlations found in all subgroups representative of cognitive authority. The use of formally published or formally produced items, presented another delimitation. Items that are published are sometimes edited for various reasons (e.g., legal, column space constraints, etc.). Because of this, the text record may not have represented the exact or naturally intended expression of the author. While the mean WC values for each subgroup are reported in this paper, the WC was omitted from the development of the cognitive model. Finally, the study assumed that the advice column submissions constituted acts of ascription of cognitive authority status to the advice columnists. It was assumed that the submission authors would not have written to the columnists if they did not believe the columnists had knowledge that they (submission authors) did not have themselves. 7Definitions of Terms Cognitive authority: authority based on thinking the source has special knowledge (Wilson, 1983, p. 14). Cognitive authority ascription:  to assign the status of cognitive authority to a source of information (e.g., person, institution, text, etc.). Information seeking behavior (or behaviour): Formerly derived from ""information-seeking needs"", these are the interrelated activities that an individual may engage in for the purpose of satisfying his physiological, affective, and cognitive need. These activities take place in social situations (T. D. Wilson, 2006, pp. 663-664). Linguistics: the science of language, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and historical linguistics (Dictionary.com, 2015) Poka-Yoke: (pronounced poh-ka-yoke) is a mistake proofing approach to eliminating errors or preventing errors that was developed by the Japanese engineer Shigeo Shingo in the 1960s. The phrase “poka yoke” is derived from the Japanese word that means “to avoid errors”. Poka yoke makes use of simple, but effective tools and signals to prevent errors from occurring (Graves, 2013, para. 1). Cognitive Authority Selection A review of the literature reveals that cognitive authority has influence in a variety of areas such religious, political, and psychological groups. Research has shown that users judge quality and credibility of information based on the cognitive authority (Rieh 8& Belkin, 1998, p. 289). Wilson (1983) builds on the writings of J. M. Bochenski, Richard T. De George, and George Cornwall Lewis when he introduces a new type of authority, “cognitive authority” (p. 13). In reference to cognitive authority, Wilson (1983) claims, “The best alternative is epistemic authority...” (pp. 13, 35-36). He later defines it as being an alternative to epistemic authority defined as, “the authority based on claims to special knowledge” (Wilson, 1991, p. 259). Why coin a new phrase? Cognitive authority differs from epistemic authority in that the former is not based on, “…whether those who claim authority actually deserve it…” (Wilson, 1983, p. 13). When the information is retrieved from a person’s cognitive authority, the question is settled for the person in his mind. Wilson (1983) holds that, “…we depend on others for ideas, as well as, for information about things outside the range of direct experience…Much of what we think about the world is what we have second-hand from others.” (p.10). With regard to information versus misinformation, “…they (people) want to know whether what people have said can be believed. That is the question of cognitive authority” (Wilson, 1983, p. 172). In other words, once people find information, they want to know if it is information worthy of retention. Necessity is the motivation to seek second-hand knowledge (Wilson, 1983, p.10). How do people decide who knows what about what? According to Wilson (1983), this is the question about cognitive authority (p.10). It was an underlying question that at the focal point of this research. A study of actual occurrences of cognitive authority selection may be revealing. Examination of actual selections and the linguistic patterns of the cognitive authority and information seeker may result in a better understanding of exactly how the phenomenon unfolds in everyday life. This quantitative research study accomplished this through a case study of cognitive 9authority selection using linguistic analysis. The data used in the study was primary source data materials found in repositories that contained copies of submission and advisor response records for advice columns. Summary This chapter includes a statement of the problem that this study addressed. The presentation of research questions probe how cognitive selection occurs using the theoretical framework as a guide. Additionally, the associated significance and purpose of the examination of the dynamics of cognitive authority selection has been presented, along with the study’s limitations and delimitations. This chapter ends with the definition of terms used in the study and a synopsis of cognitive authority selection. 10","chapter 1 introduction when i first began this dissertation, it was from the

information based on the cognitive authority (rieh 8 & belkin, 1998, p. 289). wilson (1983) builds on the writings of j. m. bochenski, richard t. de george, and george cornwall lewis when he introduces a new type of authority, “cognitive authority” (p. 13). in reference to cognitive authority, wilson (1983) claims, “the best alternative is epistemic authority...” (pp. 13, 35-36). he later defines it as being an alternative to epistemic authority defined as, “the authority based on claims to special knowledge” (wilson, 1991, p. 259). why coin a new phrase? cognitive authority differs from epistemic authority in that the former is not based on, “…whether those who claim authority actually deserve it…” (wilson, 1983, p. 13). when the information is retrieved from a person’s cognitive authority, the question is settled for the person in his mind. wilson (1983) holds that, “…we depend on others for ideas, as well as, for information about things outside the range of direct experience…much of what we think about the world is what we have second-hand from others.” (p.10). with regard to information versus misinformation, “…they (people) want to know whether what people have said can be believed. that is the question of cognitive authority” (wilson, 1983, p. 172). in other words, once people find information, they want to know if it is information worthy of retention. necessity is the motivation to seek second-hand knowledge (wilson, 1983, p.10). how do people decide who knows what about what? according to wilson (1983), this is the question about cognitive authority (p.10). it was an underlying question that at the focal point of this research. a study of actual occurrences of cognitive authority selection may be revealing. examination of actual selections and the linguistic patterns of the cognitive authority and information seeker may result in a better understanding of exactly how the phenomenon unfolds in everyday life. this quantitative research study accomplished this through a case study of cognitive 9 authority selection using linguistic analysis. the data used in the study was primary source data materials found in repositories that contained copies of submission and advisor response records for advice columns. summary this chapter includes a statement of the problem that this study addressed. the presentation of research questions probe how cognitive selection occurs using the theoretical framework as a guide. additionally, the associated significance and purpose of the examination of the dynamics of cognitive authority selection has been presented, along with the study’s limitations and delimitations. this chapter ends with the definition of terms used in the study and a synopsis of cognitive authority selection. 10",chapter 1 introduction when i first began this dissertation it was from the perspective of wanting to know whether the relationships between jim jones and his followers started out as cognitive authority ca relationships as i got further into my research i became more interested in modeling cognitive authority relationships as a means of identifying it in any situation my intention was to use the known to reveal the unknown by analyzing situations where information seekers solicited advice from someone after i analyzed the data of known cognitive authority relationships i examined the results to see if they could be conveyed in a concise manner taking future research possibilities into consideration i wondered if the results could also be easily compared to similar studies while the results could be compared to other studies that used linguistic analysis it did not appear that this could be done in a concise manner ie lengthy explanation would have been required i began to focus my efforts on developing an instrument that would facilitate modeling the results of my linguistic analysis as development of the instrument proceeded it grew into a classification system that not only could be used to model the word usage patterns of those involved in a cognitive authority relationship but any relationship where the parties’ word usage patterns can be analyzed i came to the realization that my dissertation had evolved into three parts any one of the parts could have possibly existed alone as a single dissertation with the approval of my dissertation chairperson i rescoped my dissertation to exclude the jonestown study and focused my efforts on developing an instrument to detect and model cognitive authority the information presented in this paper is the result of the “re1 scoping” as such it includes the linguistic analysis of the known cognitive authority relationships and the development of the classification system as the modeling instrument future studies can be performed on jonestown branch davidian and other group as studies and the classification system will afford the ability to readily compare the results informationseeking behavior is a mixture of activities and attitudes oftentimes motivated by an individual’s need to make a decision one underlying element of this mixture is cognitive authority – which sources eg individuals institutions texts etc can be trusted to fulfil the information needs in order to gain insight into the dynamics of cognitive authority selection behavior this study explored primary source text data that reflect selection in the mundaneness of life advice column submissions and responses first linguistic analysis was used on the advice column data to reveal latent factors that the cognitive authority and the information seeker share that may have contributed to the selection of a cognitive authority the results were used to develop a cognitive authority relationship detection and prediction model the findings and implications of this study may provide a contribution to the body of work in the area of information literacy and information seeker behavior by revealing factors that information scientists can address to help meet information seekers’ needs the focus of this study was on “what” a cognitive authority relationship consisted of rather than “why” the various factors existed however the reason for the factors presence is equally important and would be a good topic for future research 2 statement of the problem patrick wilson 1983 posed the question “what leads us to seek secondhand knowledge and to whom are we led” p 10 to which he asserts that necessity is the motivation for the seeking and “…to whom we think know something we do not know” is the source to which we turn for the knowledge wilson 1983 p10 this secondhand source of knowledge is what wilson refers to as “cognitive authority” to explain how and why there seems to be a variety of kinds and amounts of information as well as perceived acceptable sources one much examine “…how they decide who knows what about what” wilson 1983 p 10 examination of the literature reveals that there is a lack of quantitative studies that examine actual occurrences of cognitive authority selection where the outcome of that selection is known the study utilized quantitative methods to reveal underlying factors that influence cognitive authority selection in everyday mundane life situation the data used in the study was from a sampling of primary source data in the form of advice column submissions and responses newspaper columns blogs and websites contact information was not available for the authors of the advice column submissions so there was no opportunity to contact the authors determine the result of the advice or fill in any missing information although the outcomes resulting from the advice column activity was not available the data was appropriate for the study for two reasons the first reason is that the advice column submissions were more typical of everyday life the second reason is that the act of a submission author seeking advice from the columnist represented cognitive authority selection according to how wilson describes it the author must have thought the columnist knew something that he the 3 author did not know because of this the advice columnistsbloggers and their respective information seekers were in cognitive authority relationships the research made usage of the information that was available because exploration of the data had the potential of adding to the body of cognitive authority selection research 4 purpose of the study this quantitative study was designed to identify any underlying factors that contribute to cognitive authority ascription the idea is that by analyzing known cognitive authority selections better insight into the dynamics of the ascription process may be gained identifying the characteristics that the cognitive authority and the information seekers share as well as any factors that contribute to the cognitive authority ascription dynamic may lend some predictability of selection the findings and implications of this study may also provide valuable information that can contribute to the area of information literacy by way of credible source selection training that can help meet information needs it has the potential to assist information scientists to design information sources that are better suited to meet the target information users’ needs additionally the findings in this study could be used to help law enforcement identify persons of interest who are likely to ascribe cognitive authority to a known unlawful party primary source data from advice columns were used the occurrences of cognitive authority selection in everyday life tend to be less extreme and play out in simple ways such as asking a neighbor to recommend a lawn fertilizer or submitting a question to a blog or advice column hence advice column data represented ca ascription in everyday life even though the study was not be experimental exploration of data from mundane circumstances provided a level of normalcy for the findings 5 the first goal of this study was to identify any linguistic social and psychological states that may have been shared by the cognitive authority and information seekers that may have facilitated their relationship the findings were used to develop a linguistic model of a cognitive authority relationship the study was designed to address four research questions research questions this study attempts to answer the following questions rq1 which linguistic patterns are common to both the cognitive authority caπ and the information seeker caλ rq2 which linguistic patterns exists between the cognitive authority caπ and the information seeker caλ rq3 which linguistic characteristics are exclusive to the cognitive authority caπ rq4 which linguistic patterns are exclusive to the information seeker caλ limitations delimitations and assumptions of the study linguistic inquiry word count liwc2015 software was used to provide qualitative analysis one of the limitations of liwc is that its analysis does not take into account context “…make it unable to detect the contextual” fernándezcabana garcíacaballero

and intent of their utterances will be miscoded” tausczik  pennebaker 2010 p30 in a study done by kahn tobin massey and anderson 2007 it was found that liwc’s inability to detect context was not sufficient enough to eliminate it as a measure of emotional expression p 281 another limitation was that the data that was used were text or digital records no actual humans with firsthand experience were interviewed who may be able to lend clarity or insight into the context in which the records were produced a delimitation is that this study only considered statistically significant correlations found in all subgroups representative of cognitive authority the use of formally published or formally produced items presented another delimitation items that are published are sometimes edited for various reasons eg legal column space constraints etc because of this the text record may not have represented the exact or naturally intended expression of the author while the mean wc values for each subgroup are reported in this paper the wc was omitted from the development of the cognitive model finally the study assumed that the advice column submissions constituted acts of ascription of cognitive authority status to the advice columnists it was assumed that the submission authors would not have written to the columnists if they did not believe the columnists had knowledge that they

authority selection using linguistic analysis the data used in the study was primary source data materials found in repositories that contained copies of submission and advisor response records for advice columns summary this chapter includes a statement of the problem that this study addressed the presentation of research questions probe how cognitive selection occurs using the theoretical framework as a guide additionally the associated significance and purpose of the examination of the dynamics of cognitive authority selection has been presented along with the study s limitations and delimitations this chapter ends with the definition of terms used in the study and a synopsis of cognitive authority selection ,chapter introduct when i first began thi dissert it wa from the perspect of want to know whether the relationship between jim jone and hi follow start out as cognit author ca relationship as i got further into my research i becam more interest in model cognit author relationship as a mean of identifi it in ani situat my intent wa to use the known to reveal the unknown by analyz situat where inform seeker solicit advic from someon after i analyz the data of known cognit author relationship i examin the result to see if they could be convey in a concis manner take futur research possibl into consider i wonder if the result could also be easili compar to similar studi while the result could be compar to other studi that use linguist analysi it did not appear that thi could be done in a concis manner ie lengthi explan would have been requir i began to focu my effort on develop an instrument that would facilit model the result of my linguist analysi as develop of the instrument proceed it grew into a classif system that not onli could be use to model the word usag pattern of those involv in a cognit author relationship but ani relationship where the parti word usag pattern can be analyz i came to the realiz that my dissert had evolv into three part ani one of the part could have possibl exist alon as a singl dissert with the approv of my dissert chairperson i rescop my dissert to exclud the jonestown studi and focus my effort on develop an instrument to detect and model cognit author the inform present in thi paper is the result of the re scope as such it includ the linguist analysi of the known cognit author relationship and the develop of the classif system as the model instrument futur studi can be perform on jonestown branch davidian and other group as studi and the classif system will afford the abil to readili compar the result informationseek behavior is a mixtur of activ and attitud oftentim motiv by an individu s need to make a decis one underli element of thi mixtur is cognit author which sourc eg individu institut text etc can be trust to fulfil the inform need in order to gain insight into the dynam of cognit author select behavior thi studi explor primari sourc text data that reflect select in the mundan of life advic column submiss and respons first linguist analysi wa use on the advic column data to reveal latent factor that the cognit author and the inform seeker share that may have contribut to the select of a cognit author the result were use to develop a cognit author relationship detect and predict model the find and implic of thi studi may provid a contribut to the bodi of work in the area of inform literaci and inform seeker behavior by reveal factor that inform scientist can address to help meet inform seeker need the focu of thi studi wa on what a cognit author relationship consist of rather than whi the variou factor exist howev the reason for the factor presenc is equal import and would be a good topic for futur research statement of the problem patrick wilson pose the question what lead us to seek secondhand knowledg and to whom are we led p to which he assert that necess is the motiv for the seek and to whom we think know someth we do not know is the sourc to which we turn for the knowledg wilson p thi secondhand sourc of knowledg is what wilson refer to as cognit author to explain how and whi there seem to be a varieti of kind and amount of

of cognit author select where the outcom of that select is known the studi util quantit method to reveal underli factor that influenc cognit author select in everyday mundan life situat the data use

so there wa no opportun to contact the author determin the result of the advic or fill in ani miss inform although the outcom result from the advic column activ wa not avail the data wa appropri for the studi for two reason the first reason is that the advic column submiss were more typic of everyday life the second reason is that the act of a submiss author seek advic from the columnist repres cognit author select accord to how wilson describ it the author must have thought the columnist knew someth that he the author did not know becaus of thi the advic columnistsblogg and their respect

9," 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION  This chapter presents a discussion of the research background, the problem statement, the purpose of the study, the research questions, the terminology, and the significance of the study.  1.1 Research Background  The term scholarly communication is a broad term reflecting various processes in the creation of knowledge. According to the Association of College & Research Libraries (2003), scholarly communication refers to “the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use” (pp. 1).   The process of scholarly communication consists of three different stages. The first is the conducting of research; during this process, the scholar will communicate informally with other scholars and scientists to develop ideas and create new knowledge or scholarly content. The second step in the process is to prepare and shape the work and to communicate with peers or colleagues in order to make a decision regarding what will become the formal research results. The final step in the process is the creation of the ultimate formal product that will be distributed to the broader community through one or more of the various scholarly communication forums, including both print and electronic forums. The complete process of scholarly communication starts with content creation and ends with dissemination (Thorin, 2003).  According to Thorin (2003), academic libraries and librarians perform functions at the end of the assembly line on which the problem emerges. Academic libraries are responsible for holding the scholarly content in order to satisfy the needs of their user communities; however, a growing number of cases show that academic libraries are becoming less and less able to afford to purchase the journals  2 needed for their communities due to the dramatic increase in subscription costs, particularly in the fields of science, technology, and medicine (STM), along with the declining of academic library budgets. This phenomenon has been termed the serial crisis. According to Atkinson (2003), the serial crisis is not just a library problem; rather, it is a broader crisis in scholarly communications.  The serial crisis started in the late 1980s and has become a more serious issue as commercial publishers have gained complete control over traditional scholarly publishing and, at the same time, dominated the users’ space. Many researchers agree that the introduction of electronic publishing has made this issue more complicated. Journal articles are made available as licensed materials, and this model has become the norm for scholarly publishing (Thorin, 2003). The negotiation of licensing contracts has become a challenging issue that university librarians and administers must face.   The situation is no different for academic libraries in developing countries, including Thailand. Indeed, the problem might be even more evident in those countries. The journal crisis has been reported as a widespread issue affecting scholarly communication in Thailand. In Thailand, the journal crisis was at its worst in 1997 after the Thai government decided to float the local currency. Prior to that time, 25 Thai Baht equaled 1 US Dollar; the currency exchange reached its peak at 50 Baht to the Dollar, entailing a one hundred percent increase in journal subscription rates and other purchasing prices of foreign material. As a result, many academic libraries and special libraries, particularly in science, technology, and medicine, decided to cancel their research journal subscriptions and to pull back on full-text database licenses. Access to scientific information and technical materials at that time was extremely limited. It was difficult for scholars to keep up with scholarly output (Stueart, 2000). Other issues facing  3 universities included funding for research and higher education, low staff morale due to low salaries and an unrewarding research system, brain drain, overloading of researchers with teaching and administrative duties, and lack of technological sophistication.   While the growth of digital technologies and electronic publishing appears to have made scholarly publishing more complicated, it has also helped scholars and academic librarians to explore a new direction for scholarly communication. Björk (2007) correctly sees “technology developments as a trigger for changes in scientific communication” (p. 1). Prior to the time of the Internet and information technology, scholarly communication was very slow. The advent of information technology has brought about effective ways to create, store, and disseminate scientific knowledge. The open access movement and institutional repositories have emerged as a new strategy that allows universities and academic libraries to deal with the challenges of scholarly communication in the digital age, such as declining library budgets and rising subscription fees.  Due to the increasing adoption of open access technology, scientific and scholarly information is freely available via the Internet through open access forums such as personal websites, departmental websites, open access journals, discipline repositories, and institutional repositories (IRs). Among them, IRs and discipline repositories are preferable forums for scholars and scientists since they offer features and services that enhance access to scholarly content (Kim, 2008). According to Lynch (2003), IRs are “a set of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members” (p. 2).   Since the idea of open access and IR services was introduced in many scholarly forums such as the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic  4 Resources Coalition (SPARC), there have been increasing numbers of open access and institutional repository projects worldwide. Recently, OpenDOAR, an authoritative directory of academic open access repositories, listed 2800 academic open access repositories. Lynch and Lippincott (2005) reported that in the United States, 40% of doctoral universities were already operating IRs. There were only 100 repositories registered in OpenDOAR in 2006; however, the numbers of IRs in the United States has increased during the past ten years. Currently, there are 463 open access repositories operated by 348 organizations in the United States listed in OpenDOAR. An example of a repository listed by OpenDOAR is ArXiv, a disciplinary repository operated by Cornell University Library, with a total of 1,245,393 documents (OpenDOAR, 2017).  While the numbers of open access services and IRs have increased during the past ten years, research areas related to open access services and IRs have also received considerable attention from many researchers. Initially, research centered on how IRs should be developed and implemented. Many researchers have attempted to identify the success factors for IR implementation and management (Yakel, Rieh, Markey, St. Jean, & Yao, 2009; Westell, 2006), and case studies of the development of specific projects have also been published (Chan, 2004). However, many researchers have found that the success of IRs depends mainly on faculty participation and on the numbers of items contained by the IRs (Shearer, 2003; Tribodeau, 2007; Yakel et al. 2009; Xia & Sun, 2007).   Several qualitative and quantitative empirical studies have been conducted to examine the self-archiving behavior and experience of academic authors (Allen, 2005; Davis & Connolly, 2007; Dulle, 2010; Foster & Gibbons, 2005; Kim, 2008, 2010; Park & Qin, 2007; Swan & Brown, 2005) Among them, Kim’s (2008, 2010) studies focused on faculty members’ motivation  5 to self-archive and the factors affecting their decisions to do so. Dulle (2010) studied factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication by researchers in Tanzania, using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. However, these studies focused on faculty members’ self-archiving behavior in all open access forums. The present study has a narrower focus on faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs in the Thai higher education context, particularly in research universities. Different from the previous studies, which were conducted during the early stage of IR development, the present study was conducted within a distinct context and addresses the utilization of IRs at a different stage. Therefore, it is interesting to determine whether factors identified in previous studies can be shown to be relevant to the acceptance and use of IRs in a different context. In addition, it is also interesting to investigate why some faculty members make the decision to deposit their work and what factors contribute to their decision whether or not to deposit work.  1.2 Problem Statement  Institutional repositories (IRs) have been introduced as an innovative and alternative technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars across disciplines and on a global level.  However, in Thailand, while some universities have developed and implemented IRs for nearly a decade, knowledge of the acceptance and use of IRs on the individual level remains limited. Empirical study in this area has rarely been conducted. Among such studies, Yoowang (2012) focused on studying institutional repositories’ operations from the viewpoint of academic library directors and found that some directors mentioned issues related to personnel related problems, content recruitment, and faculty involvement in IRs as problems they have faced in the management of IRs. Klungthanaboon (2013) studied the current status and the impact of Open Access and Institutional Repositories developed within three  6 research universities from the viewpoints of institutional repository stakeholders, including academic library directors, journal editors, and authors, employing a grounded theoretical and a qualitative approach. However, there have been no studies seeking to identify the factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs in the Thai context. Knowledge in this area has generally been neglected by previous studies. This study seeks to fill this gap. Since an insufficiency of knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is considered to be in part responsible for the underutilization of innovations and of information system implementation.  In addition, an analysis of factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories may provide insight into effective ways to develop, implement, and improve IRs in Thailand. Therefore, this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of IR acceptance and use by individuals by applying different theoretical models from different but related disciplines. The first model is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et al., 2003) from the information systems field, particularly relevant to the area of technology acceptance and adoption in an organizational setting. The other model is the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (Kim, 2008, 2010) from the field of information science. These two models are used together as a theoretical framework for the study.   Although there are some studies utilizing the UTAUT model to study the acceptance and adoption of information technology, there has been limited research utilizing the UTAUT model to investigate issues regarding the adoption and use of institutional repositories in higher education. Most of the studies in this area are devoted to the study of factors affecting authors’ self-archiving practices in various open access venues (Kim, 2010; Dulle, 2010; Mann, Walter,  7 Hess, & Wigand, 2009; Singeh, Abrizah, & Karim, 2013a, b; Xia, 2007, 2008). The study by Mann et al. (2009) employed the UTAUT model to study researchers from the information systems, German literature, and medical science disciplines and confirmed that attitude is a significant predictor of behavioral intention to use open access publishing. In addition, Dulle (2010) used the UTAUT model in investigating factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication in research activities at the Tanzanian Public University. Similar to Mann et al. (2009), Dulle (2010) found that besides performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, attitude is also one of the key determinants and predictors of Tanzanian researchers’ behavioral intention to use open access scholarly communication. Findings from both studies contradict what might be expected based on the original UTAUT model, which theorized that attitude is not a direct determinant of behavioral intention. This gives rise to interesting questions, since attitude has been confirmed to be significant and to have a direct effect on behavioral intention across studies related to open access scholarly communication conducted in different contexts (Mann et al., 2009; Dulle, 2010). This study seeks to fill a gap by investigating whether attitude has significant direct effects on behavioral intention, particularly in the area of the acceptance and use of IRs, which is considered as an alternative forum for scholarly communication.   The other relevant issue in the area of technology acceptance and use is resistance to change (RTC). Resistance to change (RTC) is an aspect of personality that is highly critical for technology adoption (Venkatesh, Morris, & Ackerman, 2000). Oreg (2003) found that people who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try using new technology. In the library and information science field, Nov and Ye (2008, 2009) found that users with higher RTC had higher effort expectancy regarding new technology, particularly in the digital  8 libraries adoption context. While many researchers have found that RTC is a direct antecedent of effort expectancy (Nov & Ye, 2008, 2009; Thong, Hong, & Tam, 2002), rarely has research been conducted to determine whether RTC has a direct effect on an individual’s behavioral intention to use a technology. RTC should not be disregarded as a predictor of behavioral intention, since some researchers have cited cultural inertia, a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new culture or technology, as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of self-archiving (Chen, 2004; Kim, 2008). Therefore, resistance to change should not be ignored and should be considered as one factor that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs. Clearly, it should be tested to determine whether it should be confirmed or disregarded as a determinant of behavioral intention to use institutional repositories.   1.3 Purpose of the Study  The primary propose of this study is to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the Thai research university context. This study explores the relationship and relative importance of factors that influence a user’s behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to the use of institutional repositories. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge regarding the acceptance and use of institutional repositories and scholarly communication in the Thai higher educational context. Factors identified in this study are expected to be of use to IR managers and developers in developing and improving more user-centric IRs, which may help to increase and improve the adoption and use of IRs.  9 1.4 Research Questions  To determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the Thai research university context, this study attempts to answer the following research questions:   RQ1: To what extent do faculty members in Thai research universities accept and use institutional repositories?   RQ2: What are the factors that affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the Thai research university context?  RQ3: To what extent do these factors affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories (IRs) in the Thai research university context?   Based on the theoretical framework of the present study, derived from two research models, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (Kim, 2008, 2010), the proposed research model for this study is presented in Figure 1.1.   Figure 1.1. The proposed research model of faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs.  10  The proposed research model consists of ten main constructs (factors):  attitude toward IRs (ATT), performance expectancies (PEs), effort expectancies (EEs), social influence (SO), resistance to change (RTC), altruism (ALT), copyright concerns (CCs), trust toward IRs (TTIRs), facilitating conditions (FCs), and behavioral intention (BI). While ATT, PEs, EEs, SO, and RTC are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’ behavioral intention to use IRs, ALT, CCs, TTIRs, FCs and BI are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’ actual usage of IRs. The relationships of the independent variables and the dependent variables presented in Figure 1 reflect the following hypotheses.  H1: Faculty members’ attitude toward IRs will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. H2: Performance expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. H3: Effort expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. H4: Social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. H5: Resistance to change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. H6: Altruism will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs. H7: Copyright concerns will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs. H8: Faculty members’ trust toward IRs will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs. H9: Facilitating conditions will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs. H10: Faculty members’ behavioral intention will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.  The two major theoretical models, the UTAUT model and the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior, are discussed in a greater detail in Chapter 3. In addition, Chapter 3 also explains how the proposed research model was formulated.   11 1.5 Research Design   This study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members’ acceptance and use of Institutional Repositories in the Thai research university context. A QUAN + QUAL approach was employed, in which more weight was given to quantitative data. A mixed methods design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of IRs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior. A qualitative method of content analysis of semi-structured interview results was used to extend the findings from the quantitative part of the study. This method helped the researcher gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study. Also, it allowed for capturing the participants’ views on institutional repositories in depth. Additionally, the participants’ suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method.   While the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage patterns, the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of the study allowed the researcher to study the participants’ acceptance and use of IRs and reasons related to that acceptance and use in greater detail.   Research universities in Thailand were targeted in this study. This study was conducted on research universities that have implemented IRs for their communities. While six of the nine research universities have implemented and operated IRs, findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study. The inclusion of only public universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of IRs by faculty in nearly identical organizational contexts.   12  The population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research universities. Altogether, a total of 8,399 faculty members currently teach in the four research universities, which are located in different geographic areas. According to Krejcie and Morgan (1970), the sample size representative of the population of 8,399 faculty members in this study would be 367.   The survey questionnaire employed here was developed for this study; it includes a set of questions addressing faculty members’ awareness and usage of IRs, their self-archiving experience, and factors affecting their intention and usage behavior of IRs. Factors that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs were presented as statements based on a Likert scale with a range of options across five points: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree.   The interview protocol was developed, validated, and revised immediately after the preliminary study. Semi-structured interviews through Skype and email were conducted with the participants who agreed to be interviewed. These methods are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.  1.6 Significance of the Study  Since this study addresses the acceptance and use of institutional repositories among the faculty in research universities in Thailand, it is significant for several reasons.   This study was the first to investigate faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in Thailand after the development and implementation of the first institutional repository in 2005 by Chulalongkorn University. Some studies regarding institutional repositories in Thailand had been conducted previously; however, those studies emphasized the development and management of IRs from managers’ or developers’ viewpoints  13 (Klangthanaboon, 2013; Yoowang, 2012). This study was the first to focus primarily on understanding faculty members, who are considered as key stakeholders who can make or break IRs, particularly in the Thai research university context.   In addition, the current study focused on faculty members as both content depositors and users of IRs. This study aimed to provide a holistic picture of IR acceptance and usage by faculty members in the university setting. Understanding the factors influencing individuals’ intention to utilize IRs can assist IR developers to implement strategies, derived from the users’ perspectives, to increase and improve the uptake of IRs, particularly for universities in Thailand and other higher educational institutions in similar contexts. This may lead to a more user-centered approach in developing and implementing IRs, which may in turn lead faculty, who are both contributors to and users of IRs, to deposit more materials in the repositories and to increase their rate of use of the repositories. Growth in the collection and usage rates of IRs will contribute to the success of IRs. IRs not only help scholars to disseminate and share scholarly content but also help them to access and use contents that they may not otherwise be able to access and use. IRs are also viewed as tools for preserving and ensuring long-term accessibility of scholarly content. If this mode of scholarly communication is widely accepted and used, it can in turn help to enhance the effectiveness of scholarly communication on both local and global levels.   This study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of library and information science, particularly in the area of open access and institutional repository acceptance and use. In addition, it is expected to shed light on the ongoing debate in technology acceptance research regarding an individual’s attitude toward technology and resistance to change, particularly in the area of IRs, as it provides evidence for whether to confirm or to  14 disregard both factors as determinants of behavioral intention toward the acceptance and use of IRs as a new scholarly communication tool.    1.7 Definitions of Terms  An institutional repository (IR) is a set of services and technologies that a university provides for its community members to collect, store, disseminate, and preserve digital materials created by its community members. The digital material may include, but is not limited to journal articles (pre-print and post-print), theses and dissertations, book chapters, research reports, data sets, conference papers, teaching materials, lecture notes, and other multimedia objects. Although the community members in the context of a repository are faculty, research staff, and students, this study focused solely on faculty members. The term university-based IRs is used interchangeably with institutional repositories (IRs) in the current study to refer to institutional repositories operated by research universities.  The term research university refers to the nine universities in Thailand’s National Research University (NRU) initiative. The NRU initiative project was launched in 2009 by The Ministry of Education (Thailand) through the Office of the Higher Education Commission. The nine universities are Chiang Mai University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University, King Mongkut University of Technology Thonburi, Khon Kaen University, Mahidol University, Prince of Songkhla University, Suranaree University of Technology, and Thammasat University. The national research universities have received a large proportion of the research funding from the Thai government (Sombatsompop, Markpin, Ratchatahirun, Yochai, Wongkaew, & Premkamolnetr, 2010). Although there are nine research universities in Thailand, not all of them have operated institutional repositories. The exclusion of universities that have not operated institutional repositories left six universities as targeted universities for this study. However,  15 findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study:  Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, Prince of Songkhla University, and Suranaree University of Technology.  Faculty members in the Thai higher education context include professors (full professors), associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors or lecturers (Office of Higher Education Commission, 2016; Tamronglak, 2013). Members of all of these groups have four major roles:  teaching, advising, service, and scholarly and professional activities. Some of them may have administrative duties not required of all faculty members. Instructors and lecturers were considered as faculty members in Thai higher education context; therefore, this group of faculty was considered as part of the population and included in the current study.   User acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support” (Dillon & Morris, 1996, para. 4). This study focused on faculty members’ acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the Thai research university context. Acceptance and use of a particular repository means depositing as well as accessing and using digital materials stored in the repository.   ","1 chapter 1 introduction this chapter presents a discussion of the research background, the problem statement, the purpose of the study, the research questions, the terminology, and the significance of the study. 1.1 research background the term scholarly communication is a broad term reflecting various processes in the creation of knowledge. according to the association of college & research libraries (2003), scholarly communication refers to “the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use” (pp. 1). the process of scholarly communication consists of three different stages. the first is the conducting of research;

however, the numbers of irs in the united states has increased during the past ten years. currently, there are 463 open access repositories operated by 348 organizations in the united states listed in opendoar. an example of a repository listed by opendoar is arxiv, a disciplinary repository operated by cornell university library, with a total of 1,245,393 documents (opendoar, 2017). while the numbers of open access services and irs have increased during the past ten years, research areas related to open access services and irs have also received considerable attention from many researchers. initially, research centered on how irs should be developed and implemented. many researchers have attempted to identify the success factors for ir implementation and management (yakel, rieh, markey, st. jean, & yao, 2009; westell, 2006), and case studies of the development of specific projects have also been published (chan, 2004). however, many researchers have found that the success of irs depends mainly on faculty participation and on the numbers of items contained by the irs (shearer, 2003; tribodeau, 2007; yakel et al. 2009; xia & sun, 2007). several qualitative and quantitative empirical studies have been conducted to examine the self-archiving behavior and experience of academic authors (allen, 2005; davis & connolly, 2007; dulle, 2010; foster & gibbons, 2005; kim, 2008, 2010; park & qin, 2007; swan & brown, 2005) among them, kim’s (2008, 2010) studies focused on faculty members’ motivation 5 to self-archive and the factors affecting their decisions to do so. dulle (2010) studied factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication by researchers in tanzania, using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model. however, these studies focused on faculty members’ self-archiving behavior in all open access forums. the present study has a narrower focus on faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs in the thai higher education context, particularly in research universities. different from the previous studies, which were conducted during the early stage of ir development, the present study was conducted within a distinct context and addresses the utilization of irs at a different stage. therefore, it is interesting to determine whether factors identified in previous studies can be shown to be relevant to the acceptance and use of irs in a different context. in addition, it is also interesting to investigate why some faculty members make the decision to deposit their work and what factors contribute to their decision whether or not to deposit work. 1.2 problem statement institutional repositories (irs) have been introduced as an innovative and alternative technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars across disciplines and on a global level. however, in thailand, while some universities have developed and implemented irs for nearly a decade, knowledge of the acceptance and use of irs on the individual level remains limited. empirical study in this area has rarely been conducted. among such studies, yoowang (2012) focused on studying institutional repositories’ operations from the viewpoint of academic library directors and found that some directors mentioned issues related to personnel related problems, content recruitment, and faculty involvement in irs as problems they have faced in the management of irs. klungthanaboon (2013) studied the current status and the impact of open access and institutional repositories developed within three 6 research universities from the viewpoints of institutional repository stakeholders, including academic library directors, journal editors, and authors, employing a grounded theoretical and a qualitative approach. however, there have been no studies seeking to identify the factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs in the thai context. knowledge in this area has generally been neglected by previous studies. this study seeks to fill this gap. since an insufficiency of knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is considered to be in part responsible for the underutilization of innovations and of information system implementation. in addition, an analysis of factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories may provide insight into effective ways to develop, implement, and improve irs in thailand. therefore, this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of ir acceptance and use by individuals by applying different theoretical models from different but related disciplines. the first model is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model (venkatesh et al., 2003) from the information systems field, particularly relevant to the area of technology acceptance and adoption in an organizational setting. the other model is the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (kim, 2008, 2010) from the field of information science. these two models are used together as a theoretical framework for the study. although there are some studies utilizing the utaut model to study the acceptance and adoption of information technology, there has been limited research utilizing the utaut model to investigate issues regarding the adoption and use of institutional repositories in higher education. most of the studies in this area are devoted to the study of factors affecting authors’ self-archiving practices in various open access venues (kim, 2010; dulle, 2010; mann, walter, 7 hess, & wigand, 2009; singeh, abrizah, & karim, 2013a, b; xia, 2007, 2008). the study by mann et al. (2009) employed the utaut model to study researchers from the information systems, german literature, and medical science disciplines and confirmed that attitude is a significant predictor of behavioral intention to use open access publishing. in addition, dulle (2010) used the utaut model in investigating factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication in research activities at the tanzanian public university. similar to mann et al. (2009), dulle (2010) found that besides performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, attitude is also one of the key determinants and predictors of tanzanian researchers’ behavioral intention to use open access scholarly communication. findings from both studies contradict what might be expected based on the original utaut model, which theorized that attitude is not a direct determinant of behavioral intention. this gives rise to interesting questions, since attitude has been confirmed to be significant and to have a direct effect on behavioral intention across studies related to open access scholarly communication conducted in different contexts (mann et al., 2009; dulle, 2010). this study seeks to fill a gap by investigating whether attitude has significant direct effects on behavioral intention, particularly in the area of the acceptance and use of irs, which is considered as an alternative forum for scholarly communication. the other relevant issue in the area of technology acceptance and use is resistance to change (rtc). resistance to change (rtc) is an aspect of personality that is highly critical for technology adoption (venkatesh, morris, & ackerman, 2000). oreg (2003) found that people who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try using new technology. in the library and information science field, nov and ye (2008, 2009) found that users with higher rtc had higher effort expectancy regarding new technology, particularly in the digital 8 libraries adoption context. while many researchers have found that rtc is a direct antecedent of effort expectancy (nov & ye, 2008, 2009; thong, hong, & tam, 2002), rarely has research been conducted to determine whether rtc has a direct effect on an individual’s behavioral intention to use a technology. rtc should not be disregarded as a predictor of behavioral intention, since some researchers have cited cultural inertia, a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new culture or technology, as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of self-archiving (chen, 2004; kim, 2008). therefore, resistance to change should not be ignored and should be considered as one factor that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs. clearly, it should be tested to determine whether it should be confirmed or disregarded as a determinant of behavioral intention to use institutional repositories. 1.3 purpose of the study the primary propose of this study is to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the thai research university context. this study explores the relationship and relative importance of factors that influence a user’s behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to the use of institutional repositories. this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge regarding the acceptance and use of institutional repositories and scholarly communication in the thai higher educational context. factors identified in this study are expected to be of use to ir managers and developers in developing and improving more user-centric irs, which may help to increase and improve the adoption and use of irs. 9 1.4 research questions to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the thai research university context, this study attempts to answer the following research questions: rq1: to what extent do faculty members in thai research universities accept and use institutional repositories? rq2: what are the factors that affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context? rq3: to what extent do these factors affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories (irs) in the thai research university context? based on the theoretical framework of the present study, derived from two research models, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model (venkatesh et al., 2003) and the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (kim, 2008, 2010), the proposed research model for this study is presented in figure 1.1. figure 1.1. the proposed research model of faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs. 10 the proposed research model consists of ten main constructs (factors): attitude toward irs (att), performance expectancies (pes), effort expectancies (ees), social influence (so), resistance to change (rtc), altruism (alt), copyright concerns (ccs), trust toward irs (ttirs), facilitating conditions (fcs), and behavioral intention (bi). while att, pes, ees, so, and rtc are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’ behavioral intention to use irs, alt, ccs, ttirs, fcs and bi are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’ actual usage of irs. the relationships of the independent variables and the dependent variables presented in figure 1 reflect the following hypotheses. h1: faculty members’ attitude toward irs will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. h2: performance expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. h3: effort expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. h4: social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. h5: resistance to change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. h6: altruism will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs. h7: copyright concerns will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs. h8: faculty members’ trust toward irs will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs. h9: facilitating conditions will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs. h10: faculty members’ behavioral intention will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs. the two major theoretical models, the utaut model and the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior, are discussed in a greater detail in chapter 3. in addition, chapter 3 also explains how the proposed research model was formulated. 11 1.5 research design this study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context. a quan + qual approach was employed, in which more weight was given to quantitative data. a mixed methods design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. a quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of irs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior. a qualitative method of content analysis of semi-structured interview results was used to extend the findings from the quantitative part of the study. this method helped the researcher gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study. also, it allowed for capturing the participants’ views on institutional repositories in depth. additionally, the participants’ suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method. while the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage patterns, the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of the study allowed the researcher to study the participants’ acceptance and use of irs and reasons related to that acceptance and use in greater detail. research universities in thailand were targeted in this study. this study was conducted on research universities that have implemented irs for their communities. while six of the nine research universities have implemented and operated irs, findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study. the inclusion of only public universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of irs by faculty in nearly identical organizational contexts. 12 the population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research universities. altogether, a total of 8,399 faculty members currently teach in the four research universities, which are located in different geographic areas. according to krejcie and morgan (1970), the sample size representative of the population of 8,399 faculty members in this study would be 367. the survey questionnaire employed here was developed for this study; it includes a set of questions addressing faculty members’ awareness and usage of irs, their self-archiving experience, and factors affecting their intention and usage behavior of irs. factors that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs were presented as statements based on a likert scale with a range of options across five points: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree. the interview protocol was developed, validated, and revised immediately after the preliminary study. semi-structured interviews through skype and email were conducted with the participants who agreed to be interviewed. these methods are discussed in greater detail in chapter 4. 1.6 significance of the study since this study addresses the acceptance and use of institutional repositories among the faculty in research universities in thailand, it is significant for several reasons. this study was the first to investigate faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in thailand after the development and implementation of the first institutional repository in 2005 by chulalongkorn university. some studies regarding institutional repositories in thailand had been conducted previously; however, those studies emphasized the development and management of irs from managers’ or developers’ viewpoints 13 (klangthanaboon, 2013; yoowang, 2012). this study was the first to focus primarily on understanding faculty members, who are considered as key stakeholders who can make or break irs, particularly in the thai research university context. in addition, the current study focused on faculty members as both content depositors and users of irs. this study aimed to provide a holistic picture of ir acceptance and usage by faculty members in the university setting. understanding the factors influencing individuals’ intention to utilize irs can assist ir developers to implement strategies, derived from the users’ perspectives, to increase and improve the uptake of irs, particularly for universities in thailand and other higher educational institutions in similar contexts. this may lead to a more user-centered approach in developing and implementing irs, which may in turn lead faculty, who are both contributors to and users of irs, to deposit more materials in the repositories and to increase their rate of use of the repositories. growth in the collection and usage rates of irs will contribute to the success of irs. irs not only help scholars to disseminate and share scholarly content but also help them to access and use contents that they may not otherwise be able to access and use. irs are also viewed as tools for preserving and ensuring long-term accessibility of scholarly content. if this mode of scholarly communication is widely accepted and used, it can in turn help to enhance the effectiveness of scholarly communication on both local and global levels. this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of library and information science, particularly in the area of open access and institutional repository acceptance and use. in addition, it is expected to shed light on the ongoing debate in technology acceptance research regarding an individual’s attitude toward technology and resistance to change, particularly in the area of irs, as it provides evidence for whether to confirm or to 14 disregard both factors as determinants of behavioral intention toward the acceptance and use of irs as a new scholarly communication tool. 1.7 definitions of terms an institutional repository (ir) is a set of services and technologies that a university provides for its community members to collect, store, disseminate, and preserve digital materials created by its community members. the digital material may include, but is not limited to journal articles (pre-print and post-print), theses and dissertations, book chapters, research reports, data sets, conference papers, teaching materials, lecture notes, and other multimedia objects. although the community members in the context of a repository are faculty, research staff, and students, this study focused solely on faculty members. the term university-based irs is used interchangeably with institutional repositories (irs) in the current study to refer to institutional repositories operated by research universities. the term research university refers to the nine universities in thailand’s national research university (nru) initiative. the nru initiative project was launched in 2009 by the ministry of education (thailand) through the office of the higher education commission. the nine universities are chiang mai university, chulalongkorn university, kasetsart university, king mongkut university of technology thonburi, khon kaen university, mahidol university, prince of songkhla university, suranaree university of technology, and thammasat university. the national research universities have received a large proportion of the research funding from the thai government (sombatsompop, markpin, ratchatahirun, yochai, wongkaew, & premkamolnetr, 2010). although there are nine research universities in thailand, not all of them have operated institutional repositories. the exclusion of universities that have not operated institutional repositories left six universities as targeted universities for this study. however, 15 findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study: chulalongkorn university, mahidol university, prince of songkhla university, and suranaree university of technology. faculty members in the thai higher education context include professors (full professors), associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors or lecturers (office of higher education commission, 2016; tamronglak, 2013). members of all of these groups have four major roles: teaching, advising, service, and scholarly and professional activities. some of them may have administrative duties not required of all faculty members. instructors and lecturers were considered as faculty members in thai higher education context; therefore, this group of faculty was considered as part of the population and included in the current study. user acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support” (dillon & morris, 1996, para. 4). this study focused on faculty members’ acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in the thai research university context. acceptance and use of a particular repository means depositing as well as accessing and using digital materials stored in the repository.",1 chapter 1 introduction this chapter presents a discussion of the research background the problem statement the purpose of the study the research questions the terminology and the significance of the study 11 research background the term scholarly communication is a broad term reflecting various processes in the creation of knowledge according to the association of college  research libraries 2003 scholarly communication refers to “the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created evaluated for quality disseminated to the scholarly community and preserved for future use” pp 1 the process of scholarly communication consists of three different stages the first is the conducting of research during this process the scholar will communicate informally with other scholars and scientists to develop ideas and create new knowledge or scholarly content the second step in the process is to prepare and shape the work and to communicate with peers or colleagues in order to make a decision regarding what will become the formal research results the final step in the process is the creation of the ultimate formal product that will be distributed to the broader community through one or more of the various scholarly communication forums including both print and electronic forums the complete process of scholarly communication starts with content creation and ends with dissemination thorin 2003 according to thorin 2003 academic libraries and librarians perform functions at the end of the assembly line on which the problem emerges academic libraries are responsible for holding the scholarly content in order to satisfy the needs of their user communities however a growing number of cases show that academic libraries are becoming less and less able to afford to purchase the journals 2 needed for their communities due to the dramatic increase in subscription costs particularly in the fields of science technology and medicine stm along with the declining of academic library budgets this phenomenon has been termed the serial crisis according to atkinson 2003 the serial crisis is not just a library problem rather it is a broader crisis in scholarly communications the serial crisis started in the late 1980s and has become a more serious issue as commercial publishers have gained complete control over traditional scholarly publishing and at the same time dominated the users’ space many researchers agree that the introduction of electronic publishing has made this issue more complicated journal articles are made available as licensed materials and this model has become the norm for scholarly publishing thorin 2003 the negotiation of licensing contracts has become a challenging issue that university librarians and administers must face the situation is no different for academic libraries in developing countries including thailand indeed the problem might be even more evident in those countries the journal crisis has been reported as a widespread issue affecting scholarly communication in thailand in thailand the journal crisis was at its worst in 1997 after the thai government decided to float the local currency prior to that time 25 thai baht equaled 1 us dollar the currency exchange reached its peak at 50 baht to the dollar entailing a one hundred percent increase in journal subscription rates and other purchasing prices of foreign material as a result many academic libraries and special libraries particularly in science technology and medicine decided to cancel their research journal subscriptions and to pull back on fulltext database licenses access to scientific information and technical materials at that time was extremely limited it was difficult for scholars to keep up with scholarly output stueart 2000 other issues facing 3 universities included funding for research and higher education low staff morale due to low salaries and an unrewarding research system brain drain overloading of researchers with teaching and administrative duties and lack of technological sophistication while the growth of digital technologies and electronic publishing appears to have made scholarly publishing more complicated it has also helped scholars and academic librarians to explore a new direction for scholarly communication björk 2007 correctly sees “technology developments as a trigger for changes in scientific communication” p 1 prior to the time of the internet and information technology scholarly communication was very slow the advent of information technology has brought about effective ways to create store and disseminate scientific knowledge the open access

to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members” p 2 since the idea of open access and ir services was introduced in many scholarly forums such as the budapest open access initiative boai and the scholarly publishing and academic 4 resources coalition sparc there have been increasing numbers of open access and institutional repository projects worldwide recently opendoar an authoritative directory of academic open access repositories listed 2800 academic open access repositories lynch and lippincott 2005 reported that in the united states 40 of doctoral universities were already operating irs there were only 100 repositories registered in opendoar in 2006 however the numbers of irs in the united states has increased during the past ten years currently there are 463 open access repositories operated by 348 organizations in the united states listed in opendoar an example of a repository listed by opendoar is arxiv a disciplinary repository operated by cornell university library with a total of 1245393 documents opendoar 2017 while the numbers of open access services and irs have increased during the past ten years research areas related to open access services and irs have also received considerable attention from many researchers initially research centered on how irs should be developed and implemented many researchers have attempted to identify the success factors for ir implementation and management yakel rieh markey st jean  yao 2009 westell 2006 and case studies of the development of specific projects have also been published chan 2004 however many researchers have found that the success of irs depends mainly on faculty participation and on the

introduced as an innovative and alternative technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars across disciplines and on a global level however in thailand while some universities have developed and implemented irs for nearly a decade knowledge of the acceptance and use of irs on the individual level remains limited empirical study in this area has

effect on actual usage of irs the two major theoretical models the utaut model and the model of faculty’s selfarchiving behavior are discussed in a greater detail in chapter 3 in addition chapter 3 also explains how the proposed research model was formulated 11 15 research design this study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context a quan  qual approach was employed in which more weight was given to quantitative data a mixed methods design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches a quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of irs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior a qualitative method of content analysis of semistructured interview results was used to extend the findings from the quantitative part of the study this method helped the researcher gain an indepth understanding of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study also it allowed for capturing the participants’ views on institutional repositories in depth additionally the participants’ suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method while the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage patterns the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of the study allowed the researcher to study the participants’ acceptance and use of irs and reasons related to that acceptance and use in greater detail research universities in thailand were targeted in this study this study was conducted on research universities that have implemented irs for their communities while six of the nine research universities have implemented and operated irs findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study the inclusion of only public universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of irs by faculty in nearly identical organizational contexts 12 the population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research universities altogether a total of 8399 faculty members currently teach in the four research universities which are located in different geographic areas according to krejcie and morgan 1970 the sample size representative of the population of 8399 faculty members in this study would be 367 the survey questionnaire employed here was developed for this study it includes a set of questions addressing faculty members’ awareness and usage of irs their selfarchiving experience and factors affecting their intention and usage behavior of irs factors that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of irs were presented as statements based on a likert scale with a range of options across five points strongly disagree disagree neither agree nor disagree agree and strongly agree the interview protocol was developed validated and revised immediately after the preliminary study semistructured interviews through skype and email were conducted with the participants who agreed to be interviewed these methods are discussed in greater detail in chapter 4 16 significance of the study since this study addresses the acceptance and use of institutional repositories among the faculty in research universities in thailand it is significant for several reasons this study was the first to investigate faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in thailand after the development and implementation of the first institutional repository in 2005 by chulalongkorn university some studies regarding institutional repositories in thailand had been conducted previously however those studies emphasized the development and management of irs from managers’ or developers’ viewpoints 13 klangthanaboon 2013 yoowang 2012 this study was the first to focus primarily on understanding faculty members who are considered as key stakeholders who can make or break irs particularly in the thai research university context in addition the current study focused on faculty members as both content depositors and users of irs this study aimed to provide a holistic picture of ir acceptance and usage by faculty members in the university setting understanding the factors influencing individuals’ intention to utilize irs can assist ir developers to implement strategies derived from the users’ perspectives to increase and improve the uptake of irs particularly for universities in thailand and other higher educational institutions in similar contexts this may lead to a more usercentered approach in developing and implementing irs which may in turn lead faculty who are both contributors to and users of irs to deposit more materials in the repositories and to increase their rate of use of the repositories growth in the collection and usage rates of irs will contribute to the success of irs irs not only help scholars to disseminate and share scholarly content but also help them to access and use contents that they may not otherwise be able to access and use irs are also viewed as tools for preserving and ensuring longterm accessibility of scholarly content if this mode of scholarly communication is widely accepted and used it can in turn help to enhance the effectiveness of scholarly communication on both local and global levels this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of library and information science particularly in the area of open access and institutional repository acceptance and use in addition it is expected to shed light on the ongoing debate in technology acceptance research regarding an individual’s attitude toward technology and resistance to change particularly in the area of irs as it provides evidence for whether to confirm or to 14 disregard both factors as determinants of behavioral intention toward the acceptance and use of irs as a new scholarly communication tool 17 definitions of terms an institutional repository ir is a set of services and technologies that a university provides for its community members to collect store disseminate and preserve digital materials created by its community members the digital material may include but is not limited to journal articles preprint and postprint theses and dissertations book chapters research reports data sets conference papers teaching materials lecture notes and other multimedia objects although the community members in the context of a repository are faculty research staff and students this study focused solely on faculty members the term universitybased irs is used interchangeably with institutional repositories irs in the current study to refer to institutional repositories operated by research universities the term research university refers to the nine universities in thailand’s national research university nru initiative the nru initiative project was launched in 2009 by the ministry of education thailand through the office of the higher education commission the nine universities are chiang mai university chulalongkorn university kasetsart university king mongkut university of technology thonburi khon kaen university mahidol university prince of songkhla university suranaree university of technology and thammasat university the national research universities have received a large proportion of the research funding from the thai government sombatsompop markpin ratchatahirun yochai wongkaew  premkamolnetr 2010 although there are nine research universities in thailand not all of them have operated institutional repositories the exclusion of universities that have not operated institutional repositories left six universities as targeted universities for this study however 15 findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study chulalongkorn university mahidol university prince of songkhla university and suranaree university of technology faculty members in the thai higher education context include professors full professors associate professors assistant professors and instructors or lecturers office of higher education commission 2016 tamronglak 2013 members of all of these groups have four major roles teaching advising service and scholarly and professional activities some of them may have administrative duties not required of all faculty members instructors and lecturers were considered as faculty members in thai higher education context therefore this group of faculty was considered as part of the population and included in the current study user acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support” dillon  morris 1996 para 4 this study focused on faculty members’ acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context acceptance and use of a particular repository means depositing as well as accessing and using digital materials stored in the repository,1 chapter 1 introduction this chapter presents a discussion of the research background the problem statement the purpose of the study the research questions the terminology and the significance of the study 11 research background the term scholarly communication is a broad term reflecting various processes in the creation of knowledge according to the association of college research libraries 2003 scholarly communication refers to the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created evaluated for quality disseminated to the scholarly community and preserved for future use pp 1 the process of scholarly communication consists of three different stages the first is the conducting of research during this process the scholar will communicate informally with other scholars and scientists to develop ideas and create new knowledge or scholarly content the second step in the process is to prepare and shape the work and to communicate with peers or colleagues in order to make a decision regarding what will become the formal research results the final step in the process is the creation of the ultimate formal product that will be distributed to the broader community through one or more of the various scholarly communication forums including both print and electronic forums the complete process of scholarly communication starts with content creation and ends with dissemination thorin 2003 according to thorin 2003 academic libraries and librarians perform functions at the end of the assembly line on which the problem emerges academic libraries are responsible for holding the scholarly content in order to satisfy the needs of their user communities however a growing number of cases show that academic libraries are becoming less and less able to afford to purchase the journals 2 needed for their communities due to the dramatic increase in subscription costs particularly in the fields of science technology and medicine stm along with the declining of academic library budgets this phenomenon has been termed the serial crisis according to atkinson 2003 the serial crisis is not just a library problem rather it is a broader crisis in scholarly communications the serial crisis started in the late 1980s and has become a more serious issue as commercial publishers have gained complete control over traditional scholarly publishing and at the same time dominated the users space many researchers agree that the introduction of electronic publishing has made this issue more complicated journal articles are made available as licensed materials and this model has become the norm for scholarly publishing thorin 2003 the negotiation of licensing contracts has become a challenging issue that university librarians and administers must face the situation is no different for academic libraries in developing countries including thailand indeed the problem might be even more evident in those countries the journal crisis has been reported as a widespread issue affecting scholarly communication in thailand in thailand the journal crisis was at its worst in 1997 after the thai government decided to float the local currency prior to that time 25 thai baht equaled 1 us dollar the currency exchange reached its peak at 50 baht to the dollar entailing a one hundred percent increase in journal subscription rates and other purchasing prices of foreign material as a result many academic libraries and special libraries particularly in science technology and medicine decided to cancel their research journal subscriptions and to pull back on fulltext database licenses access to scientific information and technical materials at that time was extremely limited it was difficult for scholars to keep up with scholarly output stueart 2000 other issues facing 3 universities included funding for research and higher education low staff morale due to low salaries and an unrewarding research system brain drain overloading of researchers with teaching and administrative duties and lack of technological sophistication while the growth of digital technologies and electronic publishing appears to have made scholarly publishing more complicated it has also helped scholars and academic librarians to explore a new direction for scholarly communication bj rk 2007 correctly sees technology developments as a trigger for changes in scientific communication p 1 prior to the time of the internet and information technology scholarly communication was very slow the advent of information technology has brought about effective ways to create store and disseminate scientific knowledge the open access movement and institutional repositories have emerged as a new strategy that allows universities and academic libraries to deal with the challenges of scholarly communication in the digital age such as declining library budgets and rising subscription fees due to the increasing adoption of open access technology scientific and scholarly information is freely available via the internet through open access forums such as personal websites departmental websites open access journals discipline repositories and institutional repositories irs among them irs and discipline repositories are preferable forums for scholars and scientists since they offer features and services that enhance access to scholarly content kim 2008 according to lynch 2003 irs are a set of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members p 2 since the idea of open access and ir services was introduced in many scholarly forums such as the budapest open access initiative boai and the scholarly publishing and academic 4 resources coalition sparc there have been increasing numbers of open access and institutional repository projects worldwide recently opendoar an authoritative directory of academic open access repositories listed 2800 academic open access repositories lynch and lippincott 2005 reported that in the united states 40 of doctoral universities were already operating irs there were only 100 repositories registered in opendoar in 2006 however the numbers of irs in the united states has increased during the past ten years currently there are 463 open access repositories operated by 348 organizations in the united states listed in opendoar an example of a repository listed by opendoar is arxiv a disciplinary repository operated by cornell university library with a total of 1245393 documents opendoar 2017 while the numbers of open access services and irs have increased during the past ten years research areas related to open access services and irs have also received considerable attention from many researchers initially research centered on how irs should be developed and implemented many researchers have attempted to identify the success factors for ir implementation and management yakel rieh markey st jean yao 2009 westell 2006 and case studies of the development of specific projects have also been published chan 2004 however many researchers have found that the success of irs depends mainly on faculty participation and on the numbers of items contained by the irs shearer 2003 tribodeau 2007 yakel et al 2009 xia sun 2007 several qualitative and quantitative empirical studies have been conducted to examine the selfarchiving behavior and experience of academic authors allen 2005 davis connolly 2007 dulle 2010 foster gibbons 2005 kim 2008 2010 park qin 2007 swan brown 2005 among them kim s 2008 2010 studies focused on faculty members motivation 5 to selfarchive and the factors affecting their decisions to do so dulle 2010 studied factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication by researchers in tanzania using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model however these studies focused on faculty members selfarchiving behavior in all open access forums the present study has a narrower focus on faculty members acceptance and use of irs in the thai higher education context particularly in research universities different from the previous studies which were conducted during the early stage of ir development the present study was conducted within a distinct context and addresses the utilization of irs at a different stage therefore it is interesting to determine whether factors identified in previous studies can be shown to be relevant to the acceptance and use of irs in a different context in addition it is also interesting to investigate why some faculty members make the decision to deposit their work and what factors contribute to their decision whether or not to deposit work 12 problem statement institutional repositories irs have been introduced as an innovative and alternative technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars across disciplines and on a global level however in thailand while some universities have developed and implemented irs for nearly a decade knowledge of the acceptance and use of irs on the individual level remains limited empirical study in this area has rarely been conducted among such studies yoowang 2012 focused on studying institutional repositories operations from the viewpoint of academic library directors and found that some directors mentioned issues related to personnel related problems content recruitment and faculty involvement in irs as problems they have faced in the management of irs klungthanaboon 2013 studied the current status and the impact of open access and institutional repositories developed within three 6 research universities from the viewpoints of institutional repository stakeholders including academic library directors journal editors and authors employing a grounded theoretical and a qualitative approach however there have been no studies seeking to identify the factors affecting faculty members acceptance and use of irs in the thai context knowledge in this area has generally been neglected by previous studies this study seeks to fill this gap since an insufficiency of knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is considered to be in part responsible for the underutilization of innovations and of information system implementation in addition an analysis of factors affecting faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories may provide insight into effective ways to develop implement and improve irs in thailand therefore this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of ir acceptance and use by individuals by applying different theoretical models from different but related disciplines the first model is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model venkatesh et al 2003 from the information systems field particularly relevant to the area of technology acceptance and adoption in an organizational setting the other model is the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior kim 2008 2010 from the field of information science these two models are used together as a theoretical framework for the study although there are some studies utilizing the utaut model to study the acceptance and adoption of information technology there has been limited research utilizing the utaut model to investigate issues regarding the adoption and use of institutional repositories in higher education most of the studies in this area are devoted to the study of factors affecting authors selfarchiving practices in various open access venues kim 2010 dulle 2010 mann walter 7 hess wigand 2009 singeh abrizah karim 2013a b xia 2007 2008 the study by mann et al 2009 employed the utaut model to study researchers from the information systems german literature and medical science disciplines and confirmed that attitude is a significant predictor of behavioral intention to use open access publishing in addition dulle 2010 used the utaut model in investigating factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication in research activities at the tanzanian public university similar to mann et al 2009 dulle 2010 found that besides performance expectancy effort expectancy and social influence attitude is also one of the key determinants and predictors of tanzanian researchers behavioral intention to use open access scholarly communication findings from both studies contradict what might be expected based on the original utaut model which theorized that attitude is not a direct determinant of behavioral intention this gives rise to interesting questions since attitude has been confirmed to be significant and to have a direct effect on behavioral intention across studies related to open access scholarly communication conducted in different contexts mann et al 2009 dulle 2010 this study seeks to fill a gap by investigating whether attitude has significant direct effects on behavioral intention particularly in the area of the acceptance and use of irs which is considered as an alternative forum for scholarly communication the other relevant issue in the area of technology acceptance and use is resistance to change rtc resistance to change rtc is an aspect of personality that is highly critical for technology adoption venkatesh morris ackerman 2000 oreg 2003 found that people who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try using new technology in the library and information science field nov and ye 2008 2009 found that users with higher rtc had higher effort expectancy regarding new technology particularly in the digital 8 libraries adoption context while many researchers have found that rtc is a direct antecedent of effort expectancy nov ye 2008 2009 thong hong tam 2002 rarely has research been conducted to determine whether rtc has a direct effect on an individual s behavioral intention to use a technology rtc should not be disregarded as a predictor of behavioral intention since some researchers have cited cultural inertia a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new culture or technology as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of selfarchiving chen 2004 kim 2008 therefore resistance to change should not be ignored and should be considered as one factor that might affect faculty members acceptance and use of irs clearly it should be tested to determine whether it should be confirmed or disregarded as a determinant of behavioral intention to use institutional repositories 13 purpose of the study the primary propose of this study is to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context this study explores the relationship and relative importance of factors that influence a user s behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to the use of institutional repositories this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge regarding the acceptance and use of institutional repositories and scholarly communication in the thai higher educational context factors identified in this study are expected to be of use to ir managers and developers in developing and improving more usercentric irs which may help to increase and improve the adoption and use of irs 9 14 research questions to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context this study attempts to answer the following research questions rq1 to what extent do faculty members in thai research universities accept and use institutional repositories rq2 what are the factors that affect faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context rq3 to what extent do these factors affect faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories irs in the thai research university context based on the theoretical framework of the present study derived from two research models the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model venkatesh et al 2003 and the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior kim 2008 2010 the proposed research model for this study is presented in figure 11 figure 11 the proposed research model of faculty members acceptance and use of irs 10 the proposed research model consists of ten main constructs factors attitude toward irs att performance expectancies pes effort expectancies ees social influence so resistance to change rtc altruism alt copyright concerns ccs trust toward irs ttirs facilitating conditions fcs and behavioral intention bi while att pes ees so and rtc are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members behavioral intention to use irs alt ccs ttirs fcs and bi are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members actual usage of irs the relationships of the independent variables and the dependent variables presented in figure 1 reflect the following hypotheses h1 faculty members attitude toward irs will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h2 performance expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h3 effort expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h4 social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h5 resistance to change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h6 altruism will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h7 copyright concerns will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h8 faculty members trust toward irs will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h9 facilitating conditions will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h10 faculty members behavioral intention will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs the two major theoretical models the utaut model and the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior are discussed in a greater detail in chapter 3 in addition chapter 3 also explains how the proposed research model was formulated 11 15 research design this study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context a quan qual approach was employed in which more weight was given to quantitative data a mixed methods design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches a quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of irs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the faculty members behavioral intention and usage behavior a qualitative method of content analysis of semistructured interview results was used to extend the findings from the quantitative part of the study this method helped the researcher gain an indepth understanding of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study also it allowed for capturing the participants views on institutional repositories in depth additionally the participants suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method while the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage patterns the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of the study allowed the researcher to study the participants acceptance and use of irs and reasons related to that acceptance and use in greater detail research universities in thailand were targeted in this study this study was conducted on research universities that have implemented irs for their communities while six of the nine research universities have implemented and operated irs findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study the inclusion of only public universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of irs by faculty in nearly identical organizational contexts 12 the population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research universities altogether a total of 8399 faculty members currently teach in the four

holistic picture of ir acceptance and usage by faculty members in the university setting understanding the factors influencing individuals intention to utilize irs can assist ir developers to implement strategies derived from the users perspectives to increase and improve the uptake of irs particularly for universities in thailand and other higher educational institutions in similar contexts this may lead to a more usercentered approach in developing and implementing irs which may in turn lead faculty who are both contributors to and users of irs to deposit more materials in the

also been published chan  however many researchers have found that the success of irs depends mainly on faculty participation and on the numbers of items contained by the irs shearer  tribodeau  yakel et al  xia sun  several qualitative and quantitative empirical studies have been conducted to examine the selfarchiving behavior and experience of academic authors allen  davis connolly  dulle  foster gibbons  kim   park qin  swan brown  among them kim s   studies focused on faculty members motivation  to selfarchive and the factors affecting their decisions to do so dulle  studied factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication by researchers in tanzania using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model however these studies focused on faculty members selfarchiving behavior in all open access forums the present study has a narrower focus on faculty members acceptance and use of irs in the thai higher education context particularly in research universities different from the previous studies which were conducted during the early stage of ir development the present study was conducted within a distinct context and addresses the utilization of irs at a different stage therefore it is interesting to determine whether factors identified in previous studies can be shown to be relevant to the acceptance and use of irs in a different context in addition it is also interesting to investigate why some faculty members make the decision to deposit their work and what factors contribute to their decision whether or not to deposit work  problem statement institutional repositories irs have been introduced as an innovative and alternative technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars across disciplines and on a global level however in thailand while some universities have developed and implemented irs for nearly a decade knowledge of the acceptance and use of irs on the individual level remains limited empirical study in this area has rarely been conducted among such studies yoowang  focused on studying institutional repositories operations from the viewpoint of academic library directors and found that some directors mentioned issues related to personnel related problems content recruitment and faculty involvement in irs as problems they have faced in the management of irs klungthanaboon  studied the current status and the impact of open access and institutional repositories developed within three  research universities from the viewpoints of institutional repository stakeholders including academic library directors journal editors and authors employing a grounded theoretical and a qualitative approach however there have been no studies seeking to identify the factors affecting faculty members acceptance and use of irs in the thai context knowledge in this area has generally been neglected by previous studies this study seeks to fill this gap since an insufficiency of knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is considered to be in part responsible for the underutilization of innovations and of information system implementation in addition an analysis of factors affecting faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories may provide insight into effective ways to develop implement and improve irs in thailand therefore this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of ir acceptance and use by individuals by applying different theoretical models from different but related disciplines the first model is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model venkatesh et al  from the information systems field particularly relevant to the area of technology acceptance and adoption in an organizational setting the other model is the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior kim   from the field of information science these two models are used together as a theoretical framework for the study although there are some studies utilizing the utaut model to study the acceptance and adoption of information technology there has been limited research utilizing the utaut model to investigate issues regarding the adoption and use of institutional repositories in higher education most of the studies in this area are devoted to the study of factors affecting authors selfarchiving practices in various open access venues kim  dulle  mann walter  hess wigand  singeh abrizah karim a b xia   the study by mann et al  employed the utaut model to study researchers from the information systems german literature and medical science disciplines and confirmed that attitude is a significant predictor of behavioral intention to use open access publishing in addition dulle  used the utaut model in investigating factors affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication in research activities at the tanzanian public university similar to mann et al  dulle  found that besides performance expectancy effort expectancy and social influence attitude is also one of the key determinants and predictors of tanzanian researchers behavioral intention to use open access scholarly communication findings from both studies contradict what might be expected based on the original utaut model which theorized that attitude is not a direct determinant of behavioral intention this gives rise to interesting questions since attitude has been confirmed to be significant and to have a direct effect on behavioral intention across studies related to open access scholarly communication conducted in different contexts mann et al  dulle  this study seeks to fill a gap by investigating whether attitude has significant direct effects on behavioral intention particularly in the area of the acceptance and use of irs which is considered as an alternative forum for scholarly communication the other relevant issue in the area of technology acceptance and use is resistance to change rtc resistance to change rtc is an aspect of personality that is highly critical for technology adoption venkatesh morris ackerman  oreg  found that people who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try using new technology in the library and information science field nov and ye   found that users with higher rtc had higher effort expectancy regarding new technology particularly in the digital  libraries adoption context while many researchers have found that rtc is a direct antecedent of effort expectancy nov ye   thong hong tam  rarely has research been conducted to determine whether rtc has a direct effect on an individual s behavioral intention to use a technology rtc should not be disregarded as a predictor of behavioral intention since some researchers have cited cultural inertia a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new culture or technology as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of selfarchiving chen  kim  therefore resistance to change should not be ignored and should be considered as one factor that might affect faculty members acceptance and use of irs clearly it should be tested to determine whether it should be confirmed or disregarded as a determinant of behavioral intention to use institutional repositories  purpose of the study the primary propose of this study is to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context this study explores the relationship and relative importance of factors that influence a user s behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to the use of institutional repositories this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge regarding the acceptance and use of institutional repositories and scholarly communication in the thai higher educational context factors identified in this study are expected to be of use to ir managers and developers in developing and improving more usercentric irs which may help to increase and improve the adoption and use of irs   research questions to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context this study attempts to answer the following research questions rq to what extent do faculty members in thai research universities accept and use institutional repositories rq what are the factors that affect faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context rq to what extent do these factors affect faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories irs in the thai research university context based on the theoretical framework of the present study derived from two research models the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology utaut model venkatesh et al  and the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior kim   the proposed research model for this study is presented in figure  figure  the proposed research model of faculty members acceptance and use of irs  the proposed research model consists of ten main constructs factors attitude toward irs att performance expectancies pes effort expectancies ees social influence so resistance to change rtc altruism alt copyright concerns ccs trust toward irs ttirs facilitating conditions fcs and behavioral intention bi while att pes ees so and rtc are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members behavioral intention to use irs alt ccs ttirs fcs and bi are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members actual usage of irs the relationships of the independent variables and the dependent variables presented in figure  reflect the following hypotheses h faculty members attitude toward irs will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h performance expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h effort expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h resistance to change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention h altruism will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h copyright concerns will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h faculty members trust toward irs will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h facilitating conditions will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs h faculty members behavioral intention will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of irs the two major theoretical models the utaut model and the model of faculty s selfarchiving behavior are discussed in a greater detail in chapter  in addition chapter  also explains how the proposed research model was formulated   research design this study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the thai research university context a quan qual approach was employed in which more weight was given to quantitative data a mixed methods design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches a quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of irs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the faculty members behavioral intention and usage behavior a qualitative method of content analysis of semistructured interview results was used to extend the findings from the quantitative part of the study this method helped the researcher gain an indepth understanding of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study also it allowed for capturing the participants views on institutional repositories in depth additionally the participants suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method while the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage patterns the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of the study allowed the researcher to study the participants acceptance and use of irs and reasons related to that acceptance and use in greater detail research universities in thailand were targeted in this study this study was conducted on research universities that have implemented irs for their communities while six of the nine research universities have implemented and operated irs findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study the inclusion of only public universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of irs by faculty in nearly identical organizational contexts  the population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research universities altogether a total of  faculty members currently teach in the four research universities which are located in different geographic areas according to krejcie and morgan  the sample size representative of the population of  faculty members in this study would be  the survey questionnaire employed here was developed for this study it includes a set of questions addressing faculty members awareness and usage of irs their selfarchiving experience and factors affecting their intention and usage behavior of irs factors that might affect faculty members acceptance and use of irs were presented as statements based on a likert scale with a range of options across five points strongly disagree disagree neither agree nor disagree agree and strongly agree the interview protocol was developed validated and revised immediately after the preliminary study semistructured interviews through skype and email were conducted with the participants who agreed to be interviewed these methods are discussed in greater detail in chapter   significance of the study since this study addresses the acceptance and use of institutional repositories among the faculty in research universities in thailand it is significant for several reasons this study was the first to investigate faculty members acceptance and use of institutional repositories in thailand after the development and implementation of the first institutional repository in  by chulalongkorn university some studies regarding institutional repositories in thailand had been conducted previously however those studies emphasized the development and management of irs from managers or developers viewpoints  klangthanaboon  yoowang  this study was the first to focus primarily on understanding faculty members who are considered as key stakeholders who can make or break irs particularly in the thai research university context in addition the current study focused on faculty members as both content depositors and users of irs this study aimed to provide a holistic picture of ir acceptance and usage by faculty members in the university setting understanding the factors influencing individuals intention to utilize irs can assist ir developers to implement strategies derived from the users perspectives to increase and improve the uptake of irs particularly for universities in thailand and other higher educational institutions in similar contexts this may lead to a more usercentered approach in developing and implementing irs which may in turn lead faculty who are both contributors to and users of irs to deposit more materials in the repositories and to increase their rate of use of the repositories growth in the collection and usage rates of irs will contribute to the success of irs irs not only help scholars to disseminate and share scholarly content but also help them to access and use contents that they may not otherwise be able to access and use irs are also viewed as tools for preserving and ensuring longterm accessibility of scholarly content if this mode of scholarly communication is widely accepted and used it can in turn help to enhance the effectiveness of scholarly communication on both local and global levels this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of library and information science particularly in the area of open access and institutional repository acceptance and use in addition it is expected to shed light on the ongoing debate in technology acceptance research regarding an individual s attitude toward technology and resistance to change particularly in the area of irs as it provides evidence for whether to confirm or to  disregard both factors as determinants of behavioral intention toward the acceptance and use of irs as a new scholarly communication tool  definitions of terms an institutional repository ir is a set of services and technologies that a university provides for its community members to collect store disseminate and preserve digital materials created by its community members the digital material may include but is not limited to journal articles preprint and postprint theses and dissertations book chapters research reports data sets conference papers teaching materials lecture notes and other multimedia objects although the community members in the context of a repository are faculty research staff and students this study focused solely on faculty members the term universitybased irs is used interchangeably with institutional repositories irs in the current study to refer to institutional repositories operated by research universities the term research university refers to the nine universities in thailand s national research university nru initiative the nru initiative project was launched in  by the ministry of education thailand through the office of the higher education commission the nine universities are chiang mai university chulalongkorn university kasetsart university king mongkut university of technology thonburi khon kaen university mahidol university prince of songkhla university suranaree university of technology and thammasat university the national research universities have received a large proportion of the research funding from the thai government sombatsompop markpin ratchatahirun yochai wongkaew premkamolnetr  although there are nine research universities in thailand not all of them have operated institutional repositories the exclusion of universities that have not operated institutional repositories left six universities as targeted universities for this study however  findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this study chulalongkorn university mahidol university prince of songkhla university and suranaree university of technology faculty members in the thai higher education context include professors full professors associate professors assistant professors and instructors or lecturers office of higher education commission  tamronglak  members of all of these groups have four major roles teaching advising service and scholarly and professional activities some of them may have administrative duties not required of all faculty members instructors and lecturers were considered as faculty members in thai higher education context therefore this group of faculty was considered as part of the population and included in the current study user acceptance is the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support dillon morris  para  this study focused on faculty members acceptance and use of universitybased institutional repositories in the thai research university context acceptance and use of a particular repository means depositing as well as accessing and using digital materials stored in the repository,chapter introduct thi chapter present a discuss of the research background the problem statement the purpos of the studi the research question the terminolog and the signific of the studi research background the term scholarli commun is a broad term reflect variou process in the creation of knowledg accord to the associ of colleg research librari scholarli commun refer to the system through which research and other scholarli write are creat evalu for qualiti dissemin to the scholarli commun and preserv for futur use pp the process of scholarli commun consist of three differ stage the first is the conduct of research dure thi process the scholar will commun inform with other scholar and scientist to develop idea and creat new knowledg or scholarli content the second step in the process is to prepar and shape the work and to commun with peer or colleagu in order to make a decis regard what will becom the formal research result the final step in the process is the creation of the ultim formal product that will be distribut to the broader commun through one or more of the variou scholarli commun forum includ both print and electron forum the complet process of scholarli commun start with content creation and end with dissemin thorin accord to thorin academ librari and librarian perform function at the end of the assembl line on which the problem emerg academ librari are respons for hold the scholarli

the dramat increas in subscript cost particularli in the field of scienc technolog and medicin stm along with the declin of academ librari budget thi phenomenon ha been term the serial crisi accord to atkinson the serial crisi is not just a librari problem rather it is a broader crisi in scholarli commun the serial crisi start in the late s and ha becom a more seriou issu as commerci publish have gain complet control over tradit scholarli publish and at the same time domin the user space mani research agre that the introduct of electron publish ha made thi issu more complic journal articl are

difficult for scholar to keep up with scholarli output stueart other issu face univers includ fund for research and higher educ low staff moral due to low salari and an unreward research system brain drain overload of research with teach and administr duti and lack of technolog sophist while the growth of digit technolog and electron publish appear to have made scholarli publish more complic it ha also help scholar and academ librarian to explor a new direct for scholarli commun bj rk correctli see technolog develop as a trigger for chang in scientif commun p prior to the time of the internet and inform technolog scholarli commun wa veri slow the advent of inform technolog ha brought about effect way to creat store and dissemin scientif knowledg the open access movement and institut

adopt of open access scholarli commun in research activ at the tanzanian public univers similar to mann et al dull found that besid perform expect effort expect and social influenc attitud is also one of the key determin and predictor of tanzanian research behavior intent to use open access scholarli commun find from both studi contradict what might be expect base on the origin utaut model which theoriz that attitud is not a direct determin of behavior intent thi give rise to interest question sinc attitud ha been confirm to be signific and to have a direct effect on behavior intent across studi relat to open access scholarli commun conduct in differ context mann et al dull thi studi seek to fill a gap by investig whether attitud ha signific direct effect on behavior intent particularli in the area of the accept and use of ir which is consid as an altern forum for scholarli commun the other relev issu in the area of technolog accept and use is resist to chang rtc resist to chang rtc is an aspect of person that is highli critic for technolog adopt venkatesh morri ackerman oreg found that peopl who exhibit higher level of resist to chang were less like to tri use new technolog in the librari and inform scienc field nov and ye found that user with higher rtc had higher effort expect regard new technolog particularli in the digit librari adopt context while mani research have found that rtc is a direct anteced of effort expect nov ye thong hong tam rare ha research been conduct to determin whether rtc ha a direct effect on an individu s behavior intent to use a technolog rtc should not be disregard as a predictor of behavior intent sinc some research have cite cultur inertia a resist to chang or reluct to adopt new cultur or technolog as one of the reason for the slow adopt of selfarchiv chen kim therefor resist to chang should not be ignor and should be consid as one factor that might affect faculti member accept and use of ir clearli it should be test to determin whether it should be confirm or disregard as a determin of behavior intent to use institut repositori purpos of the studi the primari propos of thi studi is to determin the factor affect faculti

univers context accept and use of a particular repositori mean deposit as well as access and use digit materi store in the repositori,chapter introduct thi chapter present a discus of the research background the problem statement the purpos of the studi the research question the terminolog and the signific of the studi research background the term scholarli commun is a broad term reflect variou process in the creation of knowledg accord to the associ of colleg research librari scholarli commun refer to the system through which research and other scholarli write are creat evalu for qualiti dissemin to the scholarli commun and preserv for futur use pp the process of scholarli commun consist of three differ stage the first is the conduct of research dure thi process the scholar will commun inform with other scholar and scientist to develop idea and creat new knowledg or scholarli content the second step in the process is to prepar and shape the work and to commun with peer or colleagu in order to make a decis regard what will becom the formal research result the final step in the process is the creation of the ultim formal product that will be distribut to the broader commun through one or more of the variou scholarli commun forum includ both print and electron forum the complet process of scholarli commun start with content creation and end with dissemin thorin accord to thorin academ librari and librarian perform function at the end of the assembl line on which the problem emerg academ librari are respons for hold the scholarli content in order to satisfi the need of their user commun howev a grow number of case show that academ librari are becom le and le abl to afford to purchas the journal need for their commun due to the dramat increas in subscript cost particularli in the field of scienc technolog and medicin stm along with the declin of academ librari budget thi phenomenon ha been term the serial crisi accord to atkinson the serial crisi is not just a librari problem rather it is a broader crisi in scholarli commun the serial crisi start in the late s and ha becom a more seriou issu a commerci publish have gain complet control over tradit scholarli publish and at the same time domin the user space mani research agre that the introduct of electron publish ha made thi issu more complic journal articl are made avail a licens materi and thi model ha becom the norm for scholarli publish thorin the negoti of licens contract ha becom a challeng issu that univers librarian and administ must face the situat is no differ for academ librari in develop countri includ thailand inde the problem might be even more evid in those countri the journal crisi ha been report a a widespread issu affect scholarli commun in thailand in thailand the journal crisi wa at it worst in after the thai govern decid to float the local currenc prior to that time thai baht equal u dollar the currenc exchang reach it peak at baht to the dollar entail a one hundr percent increas in journal subscript rate and other purchas price of foreign materi a a result mani academ librari and special librari particularli in scienc technolog and medicin decid to cancel their research journal subscript and to pull back on fulltext databas licens access to scientif inform and technic materi at that time wa extrem limit it wa difficult for scholar to keep up with scholarli output stueart other issu face univers includ fund for research and higher educ low staff moral due to low salari and an unreward research system brain drain overload of research with teach and administr duti and lack of technolog sophist while the growth of digit technolog and electron publish appear to have made scholarli publish more complic it ha also help scholar and academ librarian to explor a new direct for scholarli commun bj rk correctli see technolog develop a a trigger for chang in scientif commun p prior to the time of the internet and inform technolog scholarli commun wa veri slow the advent of inform technolog ha brought about effect way to creat store and dissemin scientif knowledg the open access movement and institut repositori have emerg a a new strategi that allow univers and academ librari to deal with the challeng of scholarli commun in the digit age such a declin librari budget and rise subscript fee due to the increas adopt of open access technolog scientif and scholarli inform is freeli avail via the internet through open access forum such a person websit department websit open access journal disciplin repositori and institut repositori ir among them ir and disciplin repositori are prefer forum for scholar and scientist sinc they offer featur and servic that enhanc access to scholarli content kim accord to lynch ir are a set of servic that a univers offer to the member of it commun for the manag and dissemin of digit materi creat by the institut and it commun member p sinc the idea of open access and ir servic wa introduc in mani scholarli forum such a the budapest open access initi boai and the scholarli publish and academ resourc coalit sparc there have been increas number of open access and institut repositori project worldwid recent opendoar an authorit directori of academ open access repositori list academ open access repositori lynch and lippincott report that in the unit state of doctor univers were alreadi oper ir there were onli repositori regist in opendoar in howev the number of ir in the unit state ha increas dure the past ten year current there are open access repositori oper by organ in the unit state list in opendoar an exampl of a repositori list by opendoar is arxiv a disciplinari repositori oper by cornel univers librari with a total of document opendoar while the number of open access servic and ir have increas dure the past ten year research area relat to open access servic and ir have also receiv consider attent from mani research initi research center on how ir should be develop and implement mani research have attempt to identifi the success factor for ir implement and manag yakel rieh markey st jean yao westel and case studi of the develop of specif project have also been publish chan howev mani research have found that the success of ir depend mainli on faculti particip and on the number of item contain by the ir shearer tribodeau yakel et al xia sun sever qualit and quantit empir studi have been conduct to examin the selfarchiv behavior and experi of academ author allen davi connolli dull foster gibbon kim park qin swan brown among them kim s studi focus on faculti member motiv to selfarch and the factor affect their decis to do so dull studi factor affect the adopt of open access scholarli commun by research in tanzania use the unifi theori of accept and use of technolog utaut model howev these studi focus on faculti member selfarchiv behavior in all open access forum the present studi ha a narrow focu on faculti member accept and use of ir in the thai higher educ context particularli in research univers differ from the previou studi which were conduct dure the earli stage of ir develop the present studi wa conduct within a distinct context and address the util of ir at a differ stage therefor it is interest to determin whether factor identifi in previou studi can be shown to be relev to the accept and use of ir in a differ context in addit it is also interest to investig whi some faculti member make the decis to deposit their work and what factor contribut to their decis whether or not to deposit work problem statement institut repositori ir have been introduc a an innov and altern technolog for scholarli commun and have receiv consider attent from scholar across disciplin and on a global level howev in thailand while some univers have develop and implement ir for nearli a decad knowledg of the accept and use of ir on the individu level remain limit empir studi in thi area ha rare been conduct among such studi yoowang focus on studi institut repositori oper from the viewpoint of academ librari director and found that some director mention issu relat to personnel relat problem content recruit and faculti involv in ir a problem they have face in the manag of ir klungthanaboon studi the current statu and the impact of open access and institut repositori develop within three research univers from the viewpoint of institut repositori stakehold includ academ librari director journal editor and author employ a ground theoret and a qualit approach howev there have been no studi seek to identifi the factor affect faculti member accept and use of ir in the thai context knowledg in thi area ha gener been neglect by previou studi thi studi seek to fill thi gap sinc an insuffici of knowledg of technolog accept and adopt at the individu level is consid to be in part respons for the underutil of innov and of inform system implement in addit an analysi of factor affect faculti member accept and use of institut repositori may provid insight into effect way to develop implement and improv ir in thailand therefor thi studi seek to uncov knowledg regard the level of ir accept and use by individu by appli differ theoret model from differ but relat disciplin the first model is the unifi theori of accept and use of technolog utaut model venkatesh et al from the inform system field particularli relev to the area of technolog accept and adopt in an organiz set the other model is the model of faculti s selfarchiv behavior kim from the field of inform scienc these two model are use togeth a a theoret framework for the studi although there are some studi util the utaut model to studi the accept and adopt of inform technolog there ha been limit research util the utaut model to investig issu regard the adopt and use of institut repositori in higher educ most of the studi in thi area are devot to the studi of factor affect author selfarchiv practic in variou open access venu kim dull mann walter hess wigand singeh abrizah karim a b xia the studi by mann et al employ the utaut model to studi research from the inform system german literatur and medic scienc disciplin and confirm that attitud is a signific predictor of behavior intent to use open access publish in addit dull use the utaut model in investig factor affect the adopt of open access scholarli commun in research activ at the tanzanian public univers similar to mann et al dull found that besid perform expect effort expect and social influenc attitud is also one of the key determin and predictor of tanzanian research behavior intent to use open access scholarli commun find from both studi contradict what might be expect base on the origin utaut model which theoriz that attitud is not a direct determin of behavior intent thi give rise to interest question sinc attitud ha been confirm to be signific and to have a direct effect on behavior intent across studi relat to open access scholarli commun conduct in differ context mann et al dull thi studi seek to fill a gap by investig whether attitud ha signific direct effect on behavior intent particularli in the area of the accept and use of ir which is consid a an altern forum for scholarli commun the other relev issu in the area of technolog accept and use is resist to chang rtc resist to chang rtc is an aspect of person that is highli critic for technolog adopt venkatesh morri ackerman oreg found that peopl who exhibit higher level of resist to chang were le like to tri use new technolog in the librari and inform scienc field nov and ye found that user with higher rtc had higher effort expect regard new technolog particularli in the digit librari adopt context while mani research have found that rtc is a direct anteced of effort expect nov ye thong hong tam rare ha research been conduct to determin whether rtc ha a direct effect on an individu s behavior intent to use a technolog rtc should not be disregard a a predictor of behavior intent sinc some research have cite cultur inertia a resist to chang or reluct to adopt new cultur or technolog a one of the reason for the slow adopt of selfarchiv chen kim therefor resist to chang should not be ignor and should be consid a one factor that might affect faculti member accept and use of ir clearli it should be test to determin whether it should be confirm or disregard a a determin of behavior intent to use institut repositori purpos of the studi the primari propos of thi studi is to determin the factor affect faculti accept and use of universitybas institut repositori in the thai research univers context thi studi explor the relationship and rel import of factor that influenc a user s behavior intent and usag behavior in relat to the use of institut repositori thi studi contribut to the exist bodi of knowledg regard the accept and use of institut repositori and scholarli commun in the thai higher educ context factor identifi in thi studi are expect to be of use to ir manag and develop in develop and improv more usercentr ir which may help to increas and improv the adopt and use of ir research question to determin the factor affect faculti accept and use of universitybas institut repositori in the thai research univers context thi studi attempt to answer the follow research question rq to what extent do faculti member in thai research univers accept and use institut repositori rq what are the factor that affect faculti member accept and use of institut repositori in the thai research univers context rq to what extent do these factor affect faculti member accept and use of institut repositori ir in the thai research univers context base on the theoret framework of the present studi deriv from two research model the unifi theori of accept and use of technolog utaut model venkatesh et al and the model of faculti s selfarchiv behavior kim the propos research model for thi studi is present in figur figur the propos research model of faculti member accept and use of ir the propos research model consist of ten main construct factor attitud toward ir att perform expect pe effort expect ee social influenc so resist to chang rtc altruism alt copyright concern cc trust toward ir ttir facilit condit fc and behavior intent bi while att pe ee so and rtc are expect to be direct determin of faculti member behavior intent to use ir alt cc ttir fc and bi are expect to be direct determin of faculti member actual usag of ir the relationship of the independ variabl and the depend variabl present in figur reflect the follow hypothes h faculti member attitud toward ir will have a signific direct effect on behavior intent h perform expect will have a signific direct effect on behavior intent h effort expect will have a signific direct effect on behavior intent h social influenc will have a signific direct effect on behavior intent h resist to chang will have a signific direct effect on behavior intent h altruism will have a signific direct effect on actual usag of ir h copyright concern will have a signific direct effect on actual usag of ir h faculti member trust toward ir will have a signific direct effect on actual usag of ir h facilit condit will have a signific direct effect on actual usag of ir h faculti member behavior intent will have a signific direct effect on actual usag of ir the two major theoret model the utaut model and the model of faculti s selfarchiv behavior are discus in a greater detail in chapter in addit chapter also explain how the propos research model wa formul research design thi studi employ a mix method design to understand faculti member accept and use of institut repositori in the thai research univers context a quan qual approach wa employ in which more weight wa given to quantit data a mix method design allow the research to collect differ but complement data use both quantit and qualit approach a quantit method wa use to determin the factor affect faculti accept and use of ir along with the relationship among the factor that affect the faculti member behavior intent and usag behavior a qualit method of content analysi of semistructur interview result wa use to extend the find from the quantit part of the studi thi method help the research gain an indepth understand of the phenomenon identifi in the quantit part of the studi also it allow for captur the particip view on institut repositori in depth addit the particip suggest and comment about institut repositori were gather through thi method while the quantit method allow for gener about accept and usag pattern the follow up interview with some particip which compris the quantit part of the studi allow the research to studi the particip accept and use of ir and reason relat to that accept and use in greater detail research univers in thailand were target in thi studi thi studi wa conduct on research univers that have implement ir for their commun while six of the nine research univers have implement and oper ir find from the preliminari studi show that onli four research univers qualifi for thi studi the inclus of onli public univers facilit the studi of the accept and usag of ir by faculti in nearli ident organiz context the popul of thi studi wa thu limit to faculti member in four research univers altogeth a total of faculti member current teach in the four research univers which are locat in differ geograph area accord to krejci and morgan the sampl size repres of the popul of faculti member in thi studi would be the survey questionnair employ here wa develop for thi studi it includ a set of question address faculti member awar and usag of ir their selfarchiv experi and factor affect their intent and usag behavior of ir factor that might affect faculti member accept and use of ir were present a statement base on a likert scale with a rang of option across five point strongli disagre disagre neither agre nor disagre agre and strongli agre the interview protocol wa develop valid and revis immedi after the preliminari studi semistructur interview through skype and email were conduct with the particip who agre to be interview these method are discus in greater detail in chapter signific of the studi sinc thi studi address the accept and use of institut repositori among the faculti in research univers in thailand it is signific for sever reason thi studi wa the first to investig faculti member accept and use of institut repositori in thailand after the develop and implement of the first institut repositori in by chulalongkorn univers some studi regard institut repositori in thailand had been conduct previous howev those studi emphas the develop and manag of ir from manag or develop viewpoint klangthanaboon yoowang thi studi wa the first to focu primarili on understand faculti member who are consid a key stakehold who can make or break ir particularli in the thai research univers context in addit the current studi focus on faculti member a both content depositor and user of ir thi studi aim to provid a holist pictur of ir accept and usag by faculti member in the univers set understand the factor influenc individu intent to util ir can assist ir develop to implement strategi deriv from the user perspect to increas and improv the uptak of ir particularli for univers in thailand and other higher educ institut in similar context thi may lead to a more usercent approach in develop and implement ir which may in turn lead faculti who are both contributor to and user of ir to deposit more materi in the repositori and to increas their rate of use of the repositori growth in the collect and usag rate of ir will contribut to the success of ir ir not onli help scholar to dissemin and share scholarli content but also help them to access and use content that they may not otherwis be abl to access and use ir are also view a tool for preserv and ensur longterm access of scholarli content if thi mode of scholarli commun is wide accept and use it can in turn help to enhanc the effect of scholarli commun on both local and global level thi studi will contribut to the exist bodi of knowledg in the area of librari and inform scienc particularli in the area of open access and institut repositori accept and use in addit it is expect to shed light on the ongo debat in technolog accept research regard an individu s attitud toward technolog and resist to chang particularli in the area of ir a it provid evid for whether to confirm or to disregard both factor a determin of behavior intent toward the accept and use of ir a a new scholarli commun tool definit of term an institut repositori ir is a set of servic and technolog that a univers provid for it commun member to collect store dissemin and preserv digit materi creat by it commun member the digit materi may includ but is not limit to journal articl preprint and postprint these and dissert book chapter research report data set confer paper teach materi lectur note and other multimedia object although the commun member in the context of a repositori are faculti research staff and student thi studi focus sole on faculti member the term universitybas ir is
